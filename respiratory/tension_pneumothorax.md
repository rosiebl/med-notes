# TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX

Medical emergency.

In a tension pneumothorax, air is drawn into the pleural space with each inspiration and has no route of escape during expiration. 

The mediastinum is pushed over into the contralateral hemithorax, kinking + compressing the great veins.

Unless the air is rapidly removed, cardiorespiratory arrest will occur.

### SYMPTOMS/SIGNS

- acute respiratory distress, ?respiratory arrest

- chest pain

- tachycardia

- hypotension

- distended neck veins

- trachea deviated away from side of pneumothorax

- hyperresonant percussion note

- reduced air entry/breath sounds on affected side

- assymetrical lung expansion


### MGMT

	Give 100% oxygen
	~
	Use large bore needle (14-16G) with a syringe partially filled with 0.9% saline
	~
	Insert into the 2nd intercostal interspace in the midclavicular line on the side of the suspected pneumothorax (or into the safe triangle)
	~
	Or can insert large-bore cannula in same location
	~
	Then place chest drain in safe triangle
	
	
**Before requesting CXR**.

Inserting the cannula or needle/syringe converts the tension pneumothorax to an open pneumothroax.

#### SAFE TRIANGLE

Chest drains are inserted into a 'safe triangle' whose borders are:

- later border of pec major
- anterior border of latissimus dorsi
- line superior to horizontal level of nipple
- apex of triangle is axilla
