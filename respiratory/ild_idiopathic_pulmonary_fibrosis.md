# IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a **chronic, idioapathic, life-threatening** disease that manifests over several years and is characterised by **scar tissue** within the lungs and **progressive dyspnoea**.

IPF is a type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.

There is Iiflamamtory cell infiltrate and pulmonary fibrosis of unknown cause (also known as cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis).

Commonest cause of interstitial lung disease.

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

Symptoms:

- dry cough

- exertional dyspnoea

- malaise

- weight loss

- arthralgia

Signs:

- cyanosis

- clubbing

- fine end-inspiratory crackles

### COMPLICATIONS

Respiratory failure.

Incresaed risk of lung cancer.


### INVESTIGATIONS

Blood:

- ABG: low PaO2, if severe high PaCO2
- CRP raised
- immunoglobulins raised
- ANA: 30% +ve
- rheumatoid factor: 10% +ve

CXR:

- lung volume decreased
- bilteral lower zone reticular shadows
- honeycomb lung (advanced disease)

CT: similar changes to CXR but more sensitive - essential for dx.

Spirometry:

- restrictive pattern
- decreased transfer factor

Bronchoalveolar lavage: 

- may indicate activity of alveolitis
- high lymphocytes: good response/prognosis
- high neutrophils + eosinophils: poor response/prognosis

TC-DTPA: may reflect disease activity.

Lung biopsy:

- may need for dx
- histological changes = usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)

### MGMT

Best supportive care:

- oxygen
- pulmonary rehabilitaiton
- opiates
- palliative care input

Strongly recommended **not** to use high-dose steroids except where IPF dx in doubt.

Consider all pts for **current clinical trials** or **lung transplantation**.


### PROGNOSIS

50% 5yr survival rate (range 1-20yrs).
