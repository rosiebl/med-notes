# INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE

Interstitial lung disease is a generic term used to describe various conditions which primarily affect the **lung parenchyma** in a **diffuse** manner,  are characterised by **chronic inflammation** and/or **progressive interstital fibrosis** and share clinical and pathological features.

### CLINICAL FEATURES

- dyspnoea on exertion

- non-productive paroxysmal cough

- abnormal breath sounds

- abnormal CXR or high-resolution CT

- restrictive pulmonary spirometry with decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity  

### PATHOLOGICAL FEATURES

- fibrosis and remodelling of the interstitium

- chronic inflammation

- hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes

### CLASSIFICATION

3 broad categories:

- ILD with a known cause
- ILD associated with systemic disorders
- idiopathic ILD

#### KNOWN CAUSE

Examples:

- occupational/environmental, e.g. asbestosis, berylliosis, sillicosis, cotton worker's lung - byssinosis (see notes)

- drugs, e.g. nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, amiodarone, sulfasalazine, busulfan

- hypersensitivity reaction e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis (see notes)

- infections e.g. TB, fungi, viral

- gastro-oesophageal reflux 


#### ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC DISORDERS

Examples:

- sarcoidosis (see notes)

- rheumatoid arthritis

- SLE, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjogren's syndrome

- uclerative colitis, renal tubular acidosis, autoimmune thyroid disease

#### IDIOPATHIC

Examples:

- idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (see notes)

- cryptogenic organising pneumonia

- lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia
