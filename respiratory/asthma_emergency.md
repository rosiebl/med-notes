# ACUTE SEVERE ASTHMA

N.B. The severity of an attac can be easily underestimated.

An atmosphere of calm helps.

### PRESENTATION + HISTORY

Presentation is with acute breathlessness + wheeze.

Ask about:

- usual + recent treatment
- prevous acute episodes + severity
- best peak expiratory flow
- previous ICU admission

### DDX

- acute infective COPD

- pulmonary oedema

- upper respiratory tract obstruction

- pulmonary embolus

- anaphylaxis

### INVESTIGATIONS

Peak expiratory flow, but may be too ill.

ABG if saturations <92%.

CXR if suspicion of pneumothorax, infection or life-threatening attack.

Bloods: FBC, U&E.

### ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY

**Severe attack:**

- unable to complete sentences

- resp rate >25

- pulse rate >110

- PEF 33-50% predicted or best

**Life-threatening attack:**

- PEF <33% predicted or best

- silent chest, cyanosis, feeble resp effort

- bradycardia or hypotension

- exhaustion, confusion or coma

- ABG

	- normal/high PaCO2 >4.6kPa

	- PaO2 <8kPa, or SaO2 <92%

	- low pH, e.g. <7.35

### MGMT

Salbutamol 5mg nebulised with oxygen + give prednisolone 30mg PO.

If PEF remains <75%, repeat salbutamol.

Monitor oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate.

### ALGORITHM

	ASSESS SEVERITY OF ATTACK
	
	--> PEF
	--> ability to speak
	--> RR + pulse
	--> O2 sats
	
	Warn ICU if life-threatening attack
	~
	IMMEDIATE TREATMENT
	
	--> salbutamol 5mg (or terbutaline 10mg) nebulised with O2
	--> hydrocortisone 100mg IV or prednisolone 40-50mg PO or both if very ill
	--> start O2 if sats <92% (also check ABG)
	~
	IF LIFE-THREATENING FEATURES PRESENT:
	
	Inform ICU + seniors.
	
	--> salbutamol nebs every 15min ,or 10mg continuously per hour
		Monitor ECG - watch for arrhythmias
	--> add ipratropium 0.5mg to nebulisers
	--> single dose magnesium sulfate 1.2-2g IV over 20min.
	~
	IF IMPROVING WITHIN 15-30 MINUTES
	
	--> salbultamol nebs every 4 hours
	--> prednisolone 40-50mg PO OD for 5-7d
	
	Monitor PEF + O2 sats, aim 94-98% with supplemental if needed.
	~
	IF NOT IMPROVING
	
	Refer to ICU for: 
		?ventilatory support
		?intensification of medical rx, e.g. aminophylline, IV salbutamol
	
	If any of following signs present:
		deteriorating PEF
		persistent/worsening hypoxia
		hypercapnia
		ABG showing low pH or high H+
		exhaustion, feeble respiration
		drowsiness, confusion, altered conscious level
		respiratory arrest
	

### DISCHARGE

Before discharge patients must have:

- been stable on discharge medication for 24h
- had inhaler technique checked
- peak flow rate >75% predicted or best with diurnal variability <25%
- steroid (inhaled *and* oral) and bronchodilator therapy
- their own PEF meter + mgmt plan
- GP appt within 1wk
- resp clinic appt within 4wks
