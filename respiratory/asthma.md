# ASTHMA

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway condition characterised by recurrent episodes of dyspnoea, cough and wheeze caused by reversible airways obstruction.

Airway anrrowing is caused by 3 things:

1. bronchial muscle contraction: triggered by various stimuli

2. mucosal swelling/inflammation: caused by mast cell and basophil degranulation resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators

3. increased mucus production

5-8% population.

Most childhood asthmatics either grow out of asthma in adolescence or suffer much less as adults.

A significant number of people develop chronic asthma late in life.

Mortality: ~1000 asthma deaths in UK in 2009, 50% were >65y.

### SYMPTOMS + HISTORY

**Intermittent symptoms**: 

- dyspnoea

- wheeze

- cough (often nocturnal)

- sputum

**Precipitants**:

- cold air
- exercise
- emotion
- allergens e.g. house dust mite, pollen, fur
- infection
- smoking + passive smoking
- pollution
- NSAIDs
- B-blockers

**Diurnal variation** in symptoms or peak flow: marked morning dipping of peak flow common. Can tip balance into serious attack despite normal flow otherwise.

**Exercise tolerance**: quantify.

**Disturbed sleep**: quantify as nights per week - sign of severe asthma.

**Acid reflux**: 

- 40-60% of asthmatics have reflux
- Rx improves spirometry (but not necessarily symptoms)

**Other atopic disease**: 

- eczema
- hay fever
- allergy
- FHx

The home, especially the bedroom: pets, carpet, feather ipllows/duvet, floor cushions/soft furnishings?

**Job**:

- if symptoms remit at weekends/holidays, work may be trigger
- 15% cases work-related
	- e.g. paint sprayers, food processors, welders, animal handlers
- measure peak flow at intervals at work and home, same time of day, to confirm

**Days per week of work or school**.

### SIGNS

- tachypnoea

- audible wheeze

- hyperinflated chest

- hyperresonant percussion note

- air entry decreased

- widespread, polyphonic wheeze


**Severe attack:**

- inability to complete sentences

- pulse >110bpm

- respiratory rate >25/min

- PEF 33-50% predicted


**Life-threatening attack:**

- silent chest

- confusion

- exhaustion

- cyanosis

- **PaO2 <8 kPa**

- **PaCO2 4.6-6.0**

- **SpO2 <92%**


**Near fatal:**

- **increased PaCO2**

### INVESTIGATIONS

#### ACUTE ATTACK

Peak expiratory flow.

Sputum + blood culture.

Bloods: FBC, U&E, CRP.

CXR to exclude infection + pneumothorax.

**ABG** usually shows:

- normal or slightly decreased PaO2
- **decreased PaCO2**
- due to hyperventilation

If PaO2 is normal but pt hyperventilating, watch carefully and repeat ABG a little later.

**If PaCO2 is normal or raised, transfer to HDU or ITU**. Signifies failing respiratory effort - no longer able to hyperventilate.


#### CHRONIC ASTHMA

**Peak expiratory flow monitoring**: diurnal variation of >20% on >3d a week for 2 weeks.

**Spirometry**: 

- obstructive defect
- low FEV1/FVC ratio, high RV
- usually >15% improvement in FEV1 following B2 agonists or steroid trial

**CXR**: hyperinflation.

**Skin prick** tests may help identify allergens.

Histamine or methacholine challenge.

Aspergillus serology.

### DDX

- pulmonary oedema: "cardiac asthma"

- COPD: may co-exist

- large airway obstruction, e.g. foreign body, tumour

- SVC obstruction: whheze + dyspnoea, but not episodic

- pneumothorax

- pulmonary embolism

- bronchiectasis

- obliterative bronchiolitis: suspect in elderly

### ASSOCIATED DISEASES

- acid reflux

- polyarteritis nodosa

- Churg-Strauss syndrome

- allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis


### MGMT OF CHRONIC ASTHMA

[For mgmt of acute severe asthma see other notes].

#### BEHAVIOUR

Help to **quit smoking**.

Avoid **precipitants**.

Check **inhaler technique**.

Teach use of peak flow meter to **monitor PEF** twice a day.

Educate to **enable self-mgmt** by altering medication in light of symptoms or PEF.

Give specific **advice** about what to do in **emergency**; provide written action plan.

Consider teaching **relaxed breathing** to avoid dysfunctional breathing - Papworth method.

#### BRITISH THORACIC SOCIETY GUIDELINES

Start at the step most appropriate to severity.

Move up if needed, or down if control good for >3 months.

Rescue courses of prednisolone can be used at any time.

	STEP 1
	
	Occasional short-acting inhaled B2-agonist PRN for symptom relief
	--> e.g. salbutamol
	
	If used >1/day, or night-time symptoms
	~
	STEP 2
	
	Add standard-dose inhaled steroid or start at dose appropriate for severity + titrate
	--> e.g. beclametasone
	~
	STEP 3
	
	Add long-acting-B2 agonist
	--> e.g. salmeterol
	
	If benefit but still inadequate control, continue LABA + increase dose of inhaled steroid
	
	If no effect of LABA, stop. Review dx.
	
	May try leukotriene receptor antagonist (e.g. montelukast) or oral theophylline.
	~
	STEP 4
	Consider trials of the following in conjunction with previous therapy:
	
	--> beclametasone up to 2000 micrograms/day
	--> modified-release oral theophylline
	--> modified release oral B2-agonist
	--> oral leukotriene receptor antagonist e.g. montelukast, zafirlukast
	~
	STEP 5
	Add regular oral prednisolone.
	
	Continue with high-dose inhaled steroids.
	
	Refer to asthma clinic.


N.B. anticholinergics - muscarinic antagonists e.g. **ipratropium** (short-acting) + **tiotropium** (long-acting) - may decrease muscle spasm synergistically with B2-agonists but nor ecommended in current guidelines for **chronic** asthma. May be of more benefit in COPD.

Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody e.g. **omalizumab** may be useful in highly selected pts with persistent allergic asthma. Given as SC injection every 2-4 weeks. Specialists only.
