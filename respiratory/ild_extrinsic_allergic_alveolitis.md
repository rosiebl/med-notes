# EXTRINSIC ALLERGIC ALVEOLITIS

In sensitised individuals, inhalation of allergens (fungal spores or avian proteins) provokes a hypersensitivity reaction.

Acute phase: alveoli are infiltrated with acute inflammatory cells.

With chronic exposure, granuloma formation and obliterative bronchiolitis occur.

Obliterative bronchiolitis is a form of bronchiolitis in which the bronchioles are compressed and narrowed by fibrosis and inflamamation.

### CAUSES

Bird-fancier's and pigeon-fancier's lung: proteins in bird droppings.

Farmer's and mushroom worker's lung: *Mycropolyspora faeni*, *Thermoactinomyces vulgaris*.

Malt worker's lung: *Aspergillus clavatus*.

Bagassosis or sugar worker's lung: *Thermoactinomyces sacchari*.

### CLINICAL FEATURES

4-6h after exposure:

- fever

- rigors

- myalgia

- dry cough

- dyspnoea

- crackles (no wheeze)

Chronic:

- increasing dyspnoea

- weight loss

- exertional dyspnoea

- type 1 respiratory failure

- cor pulmonale

### INVESTIGATIONS

#### ACUTE 

Bloods:

- FBC - neutrophilia
- high ESR
- ABGs
- positive serum precipitins: indicate exposure only

CXR:

- upper-zone mottling/consolidation
- hilar lymphadenopathy (rare)

Lung function tests:

- reversible restrictive defect
- reduced gas transfer during acute attacks

#### CHRONIC

Bloods: positive serum precipitins.

CXR:

- upper zone fibrosis
- honeycomb lung

Lung function tests: persistent changes (see above).

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid shows high lymphocytes and mast cells.


### MGMT

#### ACUTE MGMT

Remove allergen + give O2 35-60%.

Then: oral prednisolone 40mg/24h, followed by reducing dose.

#### CHRONIC MGMT

Avoid exposure to allergens, or wear a facemask or +ve pressure helmet.

Long-term steroids often acheive CXR + physiological improvement.
