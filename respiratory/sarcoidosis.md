# SARCOIDOSIS

Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology, characterised by accumulation of lymphocytes + macrophages in the lungs + other organs.

Lungs + lymph nodes invovled in >90% of pts but virtually any organ can be involved.

Often a heterogenous + unpredictable course.

Usually affects adults aged 20-40y, more common in women.

African-Caribbean people affected more frequently + more severely than Caucasion people, esp by extra-thoracic disease.

Associated with HLA-DRB1 + DQB1 alleles.

### CLINICAL FEATURES

20-40% disease discovered incidentally after routine CXR - asymptomatic.

Acute sarcoidosis often presents with erythema nodosum ± polyarthralgia. Usually resolves spontaneously.

#### PULMONARY DISEASE

90% have abnormal CXR: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy ± pulmonary infiltrates or fibrosis.

Symptoms:

- dry cough

- progressive dyspnoea

- decreased exercise tolerance

- chest pain

10-20% have progressive symptoms w/ concurrent deterioration in lung function.

#### NON-PULMONARY SIGNS

There are many non-pulmonary signs, including:

- lymphadenopthy
- hepatomegaly
- splenomegaly
- eyes:
	- uveitis
	- conjunctivitis
	- keratoconjunctivitis sicca
	- glaucoma
- terminal phalangeal bone cysts
- enlargement of lacrimal + parotid glands
- neurological:
	- Bell's palsy
	- neuropathy
	- meningitis
	- brainstem + spinal syndromes
	- space-occupying lesion
- dermatological:
	- erythema nodosum
	- lupus pernio
	- subcutaneous nodules
- cardiac:
	- cardiomyopathy
	- arrhythmias
- calcium abnormalities:
	- hypercalcaemia
	- hypercalciuria
	- renal stones
- pituitary dysfunction

### INVESTIGATIONS

**Bloods**:

- ESR raised
- lymphopenia
- LFTs raised
- serume ACE raised in 60% (non-specific)
- hypercalcaemia
- immunoglobulins raised

**24h urine**: hypercalciuria.

**Tuberculin skin test**: -ve in 2/3.

**CXR** abnormal in 90%:

- Stage 0: normal
- Stage 1: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL)
- Stage 2: BHL + peripheral pulmonary infiltrates
- Stage 3: peripheral pulmonary infiltrates alone
- Stage 4: 
	- progressive pulmonary fibrosis
	- bulla formation - honeycombing
	- pleural involvement

**ECG**: may show arrhythmias or bundle branch block.

**Lung function tests**:

- may be normal, or may show:
	- reduced lung volumes
	- impaired gas transfer
	- restrictive ventilatory defect

**Tissue biopsy** of lung, liver, lymph nodes, skin nodules or lacrimal glands is diagnostic + shows **non-caseating granulomata**.

**Bronchoalveolar lavage**: 

- high lymphocytes in active disease
- high neutrophils with pulmoanry fibrosis

**Ulstrasound**: may show nephrocalcinosis or hepatosplenomegaly.

**Bone X rays**: may show 'punched out' lesions in terminal phalanges - cysts.

**CT/MRI**: can be useful to assess severity of pulmonary disease or dx neurosarcoidosis.

**Ophthalmology assessment** indicated in ocular disease.

### MGMT

Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy alone doesn't need Rx: most recover spontaneously.

Acute sarcoidosis: bed rest + NSAIDs.

#### CORTICOSTEROIDS 

**Indications for corticosteroids**:

- parenchymal lung disease: symptomatic, static or progressive
- uveitis
- hypercalcaemia
- neurological or cardiac involvement

**Prednisolone** 40mg/24h for 4-6 weeks, then decrease dose over 1yr according to clinical status.

Some relapse and need further course or long-term Rx.

#### OTHER Rx

In severe illness, may need **IV methylprednisolone** or **immunosuppressants**.

- e.g. methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide

Can try **anti-TNFa** Rx in refractory cases, or **lung transplant**.


### PROGNOSIS

60% with thoracic sarcoidosis resolve over 2y.

20% respond to steroid Rx; in others improvement unlikely despite therapy.
