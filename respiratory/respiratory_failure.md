# RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Respiratory failure is when gas exchange is inadequate, resulting in hypoxia. 

Defined as **PaO2 <8kPa**.

Subdivided into 2 types according to the PaCO2 level.

### TYPE 1 RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Hypoxia with a normal or low PaCO2.

- PaO2 <8kPa
- PaCO2 4.7-6.0kPa or lower

Caused primarily by ventilation/perfusion mismatch, e.g.:

- pneumonia

- pulmonary oedema

- PE

- asthma

- emphysema

- pulmonary fibrosis

- acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

### TYPE 2 RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Hypoxia with hypercapnia.

- PaO2 <8kPa
- PaCO2 >6.0kPa

Caused by alveolar hypoventilation, with or without V/Q mismatch.

**Pulmonary disease:**

- asthma

- COPD

- pneumonia

- end-stage pulmonary fibrosis

- obstructive sleep apnoea

**Reduced respiratory drive:**

- sedative drugs

- CNS tumour

- trauma

**Neuromuscular disease:**

- cervical cord lesion

- diaphragmatic paralysis

- poliomyelitis

- myasthenia gravis

- Guillain-Barre syndrome

**Thoracic wall disease:**

- flail chest

- kyphoscoliosis

### CLINICAL FEATURES

Features are those of the underlying cause with signs + symptoms of hypoxia and/or hypercapnia.

Hypoxia:

- dyspnoea

- restlessness

- agitation

- confusion

- central cyanosis

Long-standing hypoxia:

- polycythaemia

- pulmonary hypertension

- cor pulmonale

Hypercapania:

- headache

- peripheral vasodilation

- tachycardia

- bounding pulse

- tremor/flap

- papilloedema

- confusion

- drowsiness

- coma

### INVESTIGATIONS

Aim to find cause.

Bloods: FBC, U&E, CRP, ABG.

Radiology: CXR.

Microbiology: sputum + blood cultures, if febrile.

Spirometry: COPD, neuromuscular disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome.

### MGMT

Depends on cause.

#### TYPE 1 RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Treat underlying cause.

Give **oxygen 35-60%** by facemask to correct hypoxia.

Assisted ventilation if PaCO2 <8kPa despite 60% oxygen.

#### TYPE 2 RESPIRATORY FAILURE

N.B. The respiratory centre may be relatively insensitive to CO2 and respiration could be driven by hypoxia. Oxygen therapy must be given with care as **elimination of hypoxia could reduce the respiratory drive**. Nevertheless, don't leave the hypoxia untreated.

Treat underlying cause.

**Controlled oxygen therapy**: start at 24% O2.

Recheck ABG after 20 mins. 

- if PaCO2 steady or lower, increase **O2 concetration to 28%**.
- if PaCO2 has risen >1.5kPa + pt still hypoxic, consider assisted ventilation e.g. **NIPPV**

Rarely, use a respiratory stimulant e.g. doxapram 1.5-4mg/min IVI.

If this fails, consider intubation and ventilation, if appropriate.
