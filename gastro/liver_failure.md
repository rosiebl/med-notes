# LIVER FAILURE

Liver failure is failure of hepatic function characterised by jaundice, coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.

**Acute liver failure**: liver failure occurring suddenly in the previously healthy liver.

**Acute-on-chronic liver failure**: decompensation of chronic liver disease.

**Fulminant liver failure**: clinical syndrome resulting from massive necrosis of liver cells leading to severe impairment of liver function.

- **Hyperacute**: encephalopathy within 7d of onset of jaundice.
- **Acute**: within 8-28d
- **Subacute**: within 5-26 weeks

Decreasing risk of cerebral oedema as the onset of encephalopathy is increasingly delayed.

### CAUSES

#### INFECTIONS

- viral hepatitis, esp B, C, CMV

- yellow fever

- leptospirosis

#### DRUGS

- paracetamol overdose

- halothane

- isoniazid

#### TOXINS

- *Amanita phalloides* mushroom

- carbon tetrachloride

#### VASCULAR

- Budd-Chiari syndrome

- veno-occlusive disease

#### OTHER

- alcohol

- primary biliary cirrhosis

- haemochromatosis

- autoimmune hepatitis

- alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency

- Wilson's disease

- fatty liver of pregnancy

- malignancy

- HELLP syndrome

### FEATURES

- **jaundice**

- **hepatic encephalopathy**

- *fetor hepaticus* (pear drop smell)

- asterixis/flap

- constructional apraxia (can't copy 5 point star?)

- coagulopathy (increased INR/PT): risk of bleeding

- hypoalbuminaemia: leukonychia, oedema

- ascites

Signs of chronic liver disease suggest acute-on-chronic/decompensated liver failure.

### INVESTIGATIONS

Blood

- FBC
	- ?infection, ?GI bleed
- U&E
	- urea synthesised by liver so poor test of renal function in liver failure - use creatinine
- LFT
- clotting 
	- increased prothrombin time/INR
- glucose
- paracetamol level
- hepatitis, CMV and EBV serology
- ferritin
- alpha1-antitrypsin
- caeruloplasmin
- autoantibodies

Microbiology:

- blood culture
- urine culture
- ascitic tap for MC&S of ascites
	- neutrophils >250/mm^3 indicates spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Radiology:

- CXR
- abdominal ultrasound
- Doppler flow studies of the portal vein
	- if suspect Budd-Chiari then hepatic vein as well

Neurophysiology:

- EEG
- evoked potentials and neuroimaging have limited role

### MANAGEMENT

	Beware sepsis, hypoglycaemia, GI bleeds/varices and encephalopathy.

Management:

- ITU - nurse with 20 degree head-up tilt

- urinary and central venous catheters to assess **fluid status**

- monitor temp, RR, HR, BP, pupils, urine output hourly, + daily weights

- FBC/U&E/LFT/INR daily

- **10% glucose IV**, 1L/12h to avoid hypoglycamia. Blood glucose every 1-4h.

- **treat cause** if known

- if malnourished, get **dietary help** - give **thiamine** + **folate** supplements

- **seizures** - **lorazepam**

- if **renal failure** - **haemofiltration** or **haemodialysis**

- avoid sedatives or drugs with hepatic metabolism

- ?**PPI prophylaxis** for stress ulcers

- liaise early with nearest **transplant** centre regarding appropriateness

#### KCH LIVER TRANSPLANT CRITERIA

Fulfilling these criteria predicts poor outcome in acute liver failure.

	Paracetamol-induced liver failure	
	
	- arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion
	
	OR all of the following:
	
	- prothrombin time >100s
	- creatinine >300 micromol/L
	- grade III or IV encephalopathy
	
-
	
	Non-paracetamol liver failure
	
	- prothrombin time >100s
	
	OR 3 out of 5 of the following:
	
	- drug-induced liver failure
	- age <10 or >40y
	- >1wk from 1st jaundice to encephalopathy
	- prothrombin time >50s
	- bilirubin >300 micromol/L

Transplants are cadaveric (heart-beating or non-heart-beating) or living (R lobe).

Refer earlier rather than later e.g. when ascites is refractory or after a 1st episode of bacterial peritonitis.

Contraindications:

- active sepsis
- decreased life expectancy (~ less than 2y) from concurrent diseases
- psychosocial factors precluding immunosuppression


#### PRESCRIBING IN LIVER FAILURE

Avoid drugs:

- that constipate e.g. opiates, diuretics - increased risk of encephalopathy
- oral hypoglycaemics
- saline-containing IVs

Warfarin effects enhanced.

Hepatotoxic drugs include:

- paracetamol
- methotrexate
- isoniazid
- azathioprine
- phenothiazines
- oestrogen
- 6-mercaptopurine
- salicylates
- tetracycline
- mitomycin

### COMPLICATIONS

Cerebral oedema:

- on ITU
- 20% mannitol IV
- hyperventilate

Ascites:

- restrict fluid
- low-salt diet
- weigh daily
- diuretics
- watch out for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (infection of ascitic fluid)

Bleeding:

- coagulopathy: decreased factors II, VII, IX & X causes increased INR
- Vitamin K 10mg/day IV for 3d
- platelets, FFP + blood as needed
- ± endoscopy


Blind rx of infection:

- ceftriaxone 1-2g/24h IV
- *not* gentamicin - increased risk of renal failure

Low blood glucose, if <2mmol/L or symptomatic:

- rx 50mL of 50% glucose IV
- check often

#### ENCEPHALOPATHY

As the liver fails: 

- nitrogenous waste (as ammonia) builds up in the circulation
- passes to the brain
- astrocytes clear it
	- involves conversion of glutamate to glutamine
- excess glutamine
- causes osmotic imbalance
- fluid shift into these cells
- --> cerebral oedema

##### Grading

I: 

- altered mood/behaviour
- sleep disturbance (e.g. reversed sleep pattern)
- dyspraxia (copy 5 point star)
- poor arithmetic
- no liver flap

II: 

- increasing drowsiness
- confusion
- slurred speech 
- ± liver flap
- inappropriate behaviour/personality change (ask the family, don't be too tactful)

III:

- incoherent
- restless
- liver flap
- stupor
- not coma

IV:

- coma

##### Management

- avoid sedatives
- 20 degree head up tilt in ITU
- **lactulose** 30-50mL/8h + regular **enemas** to decrease numbers of nitrogen-forming gut bacteria
- aim for 2-4 soft stools/day

#### HEPATORENAL SYNDROME

Cirrhosis + ascites + renal failure --> hepatorenal syndrome, *if other causes of renal impairment have been excluded*.

Abnormal haemodynamics cause splanchnic and systemic vasodilation, but **renal vasoconstriction**.

Bacterial translocation, cytokines and mesenteric angiogenesis cause splanchnic vasodilation.

Altered renal autoregulation is invovled in the renal vasoconstriction.

##### Types of HRS

HRS 1:

- rapidly progressive deterioration in circulatory + renal function
- median survivial <2wks
- often triggered by other deteriorating pathologies
- terlipressin replenishes hypovolaemia
- haemodialysis may be needed

HRS 2:

- more steady deterioration
- survivial ~6 months
- best option for most is transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunting (TIPS)

Other factors in cirrhosis may contribute to renal impairment.

##### Transplants

Liver transplant may be required.

After >8-12wks of pre-transplant dialysis, some may be considered for combined liver-kidney transplant.

### PROGNOSIS

Prognosis worse if:

- grade III-IV encephalopathy
- age >40y
- albumin <30g/L
- increased INR
- drug-induced liver failure
- late-onset hepatic failure worse than fulminant liver failure
