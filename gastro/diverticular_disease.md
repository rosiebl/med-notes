# DIVERTICULAR DISEASE

	GI diverticulum: outpouching of gut wall, usually at sites of entry of perforating arteries.

	Diverticulosis: diverticula are present.

	Diverticular disease: diverticula are symptomatic.

	Diverticulitis: inflammation of a diverticulum.

May be acquired or congenital.

Most important are acquired colonic diverticula.

30% Westerners have diverticulosis at 60yo, majority asymptomatic.

### PATHOLOGY

Most in sigmoid colon. 95% complications at this site.

R sided and massive single diverticula may occur.

Lack of dietary fibre --> high intraluminal pressures --> forces mucosa to herniate through muscle of gut at weak points e.g. adjacent to penetrating vessels.

### DIAGNOSIS

Common incidental finding at colonoscopy.

Barium enema can confirm dx in pts with abdo pain and altered bowel habit.

CT abdo best to confirm acute diverticulitis and identify extent and complications.

AXR can identify obstruction, free air (perf) or vesical fistulae.

Erect CXR + US can detect perf, free fluid and collections but CT w contrast more accurate, esp in complex disease.

NB. Enema or colonoscopy risk perf in acute setting.

### DIVERTICULOSIS/DIVERTICULAR DISEASE

Altered bowel habit ± L-sided colic relieved by defecation.

Nausea

Flatulence

#### MANAGEMENT

High fibre diet may be tried.

Antispasmodics (e.g. mebeverine 135mg/8h PO) may help.

Sometimes surgical resection.

### DIVERTICULITIS

Features above plus:

- pyrexia
- WCC increased
- CRP/ESR increased
- tender colon ± localised or generalised peritonism

NB. Beware diverticulitis in imunocompromised pts who often have few symptoms and present late.


#### MANAGEMENT

Mild attacks: bowel rest at home (fluids only) ± abx.

If oral fluids not tolerated/excessive pain, admit for:

- analgesia

- nil by mouth

- IV fluids

- Abx

- CT-guided percutaneous drainage if abscess

### COMPLICATED DIVERTICULAR DISEASE

#### PERFORATION

Ileus, peritonitis ± shock.

Mortality 40%.

May need Hartmann's procedure: termporary colostomy + partial colectomy.

Primary anastamosis is possible + avoids repeat surgery to close colostomy. Has comparable mortality to Hartmann's in pts w perforation (selection bias?).

Emergency laparoscopic mgmt becoming more of an option.


#### HAEMORRHAGE

Common cause of big rectal bleeds.

Usually sudden and painless.

Usually stops with bed rest.

Locate bleeding with angiography or colonscopy.

May need embolisation or colonic resection (diathermy ± local adrenaline injection during colonoscopy may obviate need for surgery).

#### FISTULAE

Enterocolic.

Colovesical - pneumaturia ± intractable UTIs.

Colovaginal.

Surgical rx e.g. colonic resection.


#### ABSCESS

Symptoms may include:

- swinging fever
- leucocytosis
- localising signs
	- e.g. boggy rectal mass
	
Drain pelvic abscesses rectally.

If no localising signs, remember: *pus somewhere, pus nowhere = pus under the diaphragm*. Needs urgent US.

May need abx and CT-guided drainage.

#### STRICTURE

Post-infective stricutres in the colon.

### SURGERY

Need for surgery reflected by degree of infective complications.

Stage | Complication | Surgery
-------- | --------- | ---------
1 | pericolic or mesenteric abscess | rarely needed
2 | walled off or pelvic abscess | may resolve without
3 | generalised purulent peritonitis | required
4 | generalised faecal peritonitis | required

Indications for elective surgery include stenosis, fistulae, recurrent bleeding.
