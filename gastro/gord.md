# GASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is said to exist when reflux of stomach contents (acid ± bile) causes troublesome symptoms (>2 heartburn episodes per week) and/or complications.

Porlonged GORD may cause oesophagitis, benign oesophageal stricture and Barrett's oesophagus (pre-malignant).

### CAUSES

- lower oesophageal sphincter hypotension

- hiatus hernia

- loss of oesophageal peristaltic function

- abdominal obesity

- gastric acid hypersecretion

- slow gastric emptying

- overeating

- smoking

- alcohol

- pregnancy

- surgery in achalasia (failure of lower oesophageal muscles to relax, preventing food entering the stomach)

- drugs: tricyclics, anticholinergics, nitrates

- systemic sclerosis

- H pylori?

### SYMPTOMS

Oesophageal:

- heartburn: 
	- burning retrosternal discomfort 
	- after meals, lying, stooping or straining
	- relieved by antacids
- belching
- acid brash
- water brash (increased salivation)
- odynophagia
	- painful swallowing
	- e.g. from oesophagitis or ulceration

Extra-oesophageal:

- nocturnal asthma
- chronic cough
- laryngitis (hoarseness, throat clearing)
- sinusitis

### DDx

Oesophagitis from:

- corrosives
- NSAIDs
- herpes
- Candida

Duodenal or gastric ulcers

Duodenal or gastric cancers

Non-ulcer dyspepsia

Sphincter of Oddi malfunction

Cardiac disease

### INVESTIGATIONS

Indications for endoscopy:

- symptoms for >4/52
- persistent vomiting
- GI bleeding/iron deficiency
- palpable mass
- age >55
- dysphagia
- symptoms despite rx
- relapsing symptoms
- weight loss

Barium swallow may show hiatus hernia.

24h oesophageal pH monitoring ± manometry useful to help dx GORD when endoscopy normal.

### CLASSIFICATION

Los Angeles classification:

1. More than or 1 mucosal break(s) <5mm long not extending beyond 2 mucosal fold tops
2. Mucosl break >5mm long limited to the space between 2 mucosal fold tops
3. Mucosal break continuous between th tops of 2 or more mucosal folds which involves <75% of the oesophageal circumference
4. Mucosal break involving >75% of the oesophageal circumference


### MANAGEMENT

#### LIFESTYLE

- raise bed head

- weight loss

- smoking cessation (smoking relaxes the cardiac sphincter so increases reflux)

- small, regular meals

- avoid aggravating foods

- avoid eating <3h before bed

- avoid drugs that affect oesophageal motility (nitrates, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers)

- avoid drugs that damage mucosa (NSAIDs, potassium salts, bisphosphonates)

#### DRUGS

Antacids (magnesium trisilicate mixture) or alginates (Gaviscon) relieve symptoms.

Oesophagitis: try PPI (better than H2 blockers). e.g. lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO.

Metoclopromide discouraged. 

#### SURGERY

Aims to increase resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.

Consider in severe GORD where drugs not working.

Atypical symptoms less likely to improve with surgery than typical ones.

### COMPLICATIONS

Oesophagitis

Ulcers

Benign stricture

Iron deficiency

Barrett's oesophagus - pre-malignant change.

Histology:

- gastric metaplasia: low risk of malignant change
- intestinal metaplasia: 2-yrly surveillance
- low-grade dysplasia: 90% get adenocarcinoma in 6y
- high-grade dysplasia: 50% already have adenocarcinoma

### BARRETT'S OESOPHAGUS

Results from prolonged exposure of normal oesophageal squamous epithelium to gastric refluxate in GORD.

Mucosal inflammation and erosion leads to replacement of the squamous epithelial linig with metaplastic columnar epithelium.

Can be few cm to whole oesophagus, patchy or continuous.

3-5% of GORD pts get Barrett's.

Dx made on biopsy

Risk is progression to oeosphageal adenocarcinoma (metaplasia --> dysplasia --> neoplasia)

- 0.6-1.6% per year of pts with low grade Barrett's progress to ca

#### MGMT

Pre-malignant/high rgade dysplasia in young and fit: oesophageal resection or eradicative mucosectomy.

Can do endoscopic targeted mucosectomy or mucosal ablation by epithelial laser, radiofrequency (HALO) or photodynamic ablation.

- when ablation is used mucosa grows back as squamous epithelium (normal)

Annual endoscopic suveillance recommended.

If no pre-malignant changes found, surveillance endoscopy + biopsy every 1-3 years + anti-reflux measures.
