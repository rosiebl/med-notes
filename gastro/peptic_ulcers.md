# PEPTIC ULCERS

A peptic ulcer is a break in the mucosal lining of the stomach or duodenum of >5mm diameter, with depth to the submucosa.

Ulcers <5mm = erosions.

Peptic ulcers may be gastric or duodenal (or rarely, oesophageal).

### AETIOLOGY

2 major causes:

- *H. pylori* infection

- NSAID use

Other causes:

- gastric ischaemia: 'stress ulcers' seen in MOF pts

- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: gatric acid hypersecretion due to a gastrin-secreting neuro-endocrine tumour

- some drugs e.g. bisphosphonates, potassium chloride

- infections e.g. CMV in HIV pts, sometimes HSV

- Crohn's disease

- true idopathic ulcers

#### Duodenal ulcer risk factors

Major:

- *H. pylori* in 90%

- Drugs: NSAIDs, steroids, SSRIs

Minor:

- increased gastric acid secretion

- increased gastric emptying (-> decreased duodenal pH)

- blood group O

- smoking

- age

- role of stress debated

#### Gastric ulcer risk factors

- *H. pylori* in ~80%

- smoking

- NSAID use

- reflux of duodenal contents

- delayed gastric emptying

- age

- stress

- e.g. neurosurgery or burns (Cushing's or Curling's ulcers).


### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Peptic ulcers are caused by an imbalance between factors promoting mucosal damage and mechanisms promoting gastroduodenal defense.

mucosal damage | gastroduodenal defense
-------------- | ---------------------
gastric acid | bicarbonate secretion
pepsin | cellular mucus
*H. pylori* infection | mucosal blood flow
bile salts | mucin secretion
NSAID use | prostaglandins
 | cell turnover
 
Majority of duodenal ulcers are from hypersecretion of gastric acid due to *H. pylori* infection, whereas secretion is normal or low in patients with gastric ulcers.

Duodenal ulcers and *H. pylori*: 

- chronic *H. pylori* infection mainly in the gastric antrum
- impairs secretion of somatostatin
- increases gastrin release
- gastric acid hypersecretion

Gastric ulcers and *H. pylori*:

- longstanding *H. pylori* throughout stomach
- severe inflammation
- gastric mucin degradation
- disruption of tight junctions between gastric epithelial cells and cell death

NSAIDs:

- direct injury: trapping hydrogen ions
- indirect damage: systemic effect to do with inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases, especially COX-1
- increase bleeding risk: anti-platelet


### CLINICAL PRESENTATION

#### Dyspepsia symptoms

Epigastric pain often related to hunger, specific foods, time of day.

Bloating.

Fullness after meals.

Heartburn (retrosternal pain and reflux).

Tender epigastrium.

#### ALARM Symptoms

Anaemia (iron deficiency)

Loss of weight

Anorexia

Recent onset/progressive symptoms

Melaena/haematemesis

Swallowing difficulty

#### Duodenal ulcers

Epigastric pain typically before meals or at night.

Pain relieved by eating or drinking milk.

50% asymptomatic; others experience recurrent episodes.

Sign: epigastric tenderness.

#### Gastric ulcers

Asymptomatic, or epigastric pain.

Pain related to meals, may be relieved by antacids.

Possible weight loss.

### INVESTIGATIONS

If a patient has dyspepsia and is over 55yo or has ALARM Symptoms -> endoscopy.

#### Duodenal ulcers

Upper GI endoscopy (stop PPI 2 weeks before).

Test for *H. Pylori*, e.g. urea breath test or biopsy on endoscopy.

Measure gastrin concentrations when off PPI if Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suspected.

#### Gastric ulcers

Upper GI endoscopy to exclude malignancy (stop PPI 2 weeks before).

Multiple biopsies from ulcer rim and base: *H. pylori*, histology.

Brushings for cytology.

Repeat biopsy to check healing (biopsy if suspect gastric cancer).

### DDx

Bear in mind the ALARM Symptoms.

- oesophageal cancer

- stomach cancer

- pancreatic cancer

- GORD/oesophagitis

- non-ulcer dyspepsia (functional dyspepsia)

- duodenal Crohn's

- gastroparesis

- biliary colic

- acute pancreatitis

- coeliac disease

- TB

- lymphoma


### MGMT

Lifestyle:

- avoid aggravating foods
- decrease smoking and alcohol
- reduce stress

*H. pylori* eradication: triple therapy 80-85% effective

- PAC500: full dose PPI, amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500mg BD 7/7
- PAC250:  full dose PPI, metronidazole 400mg, clarithromycin 250mg BD 7/7


Drugs to reduce acid: PPIs effective, e.g. lansoprazole. H2 blockers can also be used e.g. ranitidine.

Drug-induced ulcers: stop drug if possible. PPIs for treatment and prevention for pts on NSAID or antiplatelet drugs. Misoprostol alternative.

### COMPLICATIONS

Bleeding

Perforation

Malignancy

Decreased gastric outflow
