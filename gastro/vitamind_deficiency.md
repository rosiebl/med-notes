# VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY

Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of <50 nanomol/L (<20 nanograms/mL).

Vitamin D insufficiency is regarded as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of between 52 and 72 nanomol/L (21 and 29 nanograms/mL).

Very common.

### AETIOLOGY

Major source is exposure to sunlight so lack of this is a cause of deficiency.

Lack of dietary supplementation is another important cause. e.g.,

- infants only having breast milk at high risk
- intestinal malabsorption syndromes:
	- coeliac disease
	- CF
	- Crohn's disease
	- Whipple's disease
	- short bowel syndrome
	- gastric bypass surgery

Other causes:

- severe liver failure
- obesity
- inherited disorders
- chronic kidney disease 
- granulomatous disorders
- primary hyperparathyroidism
- hyperthyroidism

### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Very underdiagnosed because does not present with symptoms until the deficiency is severe and longstanding.

Has skeletal effects and also increases the risk of many chronic conditions including:

- cancer
- autoimmune disease
- T2DM
- heart disease and HTN
- infectious diseases
- osteoarthritis
- depression
- schizophrenia

[See notes on metabolic bone disorders for more detail]

### TREATMENT

Vitamin D supplementation and sensible sun exposure.
