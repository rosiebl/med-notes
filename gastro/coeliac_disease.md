# COELIAC DISEASE

T-cell mediated autoimmune disease of the small bowel in which prolamin (gluten) intolerance causes villous atrophy and malabsorption (including of bile acids).

Associations:

- HLA DQ2 in 95%, otherwise DQ8
- autoimmune disease
- dermatitis herpetiformis

Prevalence: 1 in 300-1500 - commoner if Irish + in Caucasians.

Any age but peaks in infancy and 50-60y.

F:M 1:1

10% prevalence in 1st degree relatives and 30% relative risk for siblings.

- low B12
- low ferritin

Antibodies - 95% specific unless pt IgA deficient:

- alpha-gliadin
- transglutaminase
- anti-endomysial

Duodenal biopsy done at endoscopy:

- subtotal villous atrophy
- increased intra-eipthelial WBC
- crypt hyperplasia
- reversing on gluten-free diet

Exclude in all labelled as IBS.

Lifelong gluten free diet.

Verify diet by endomysial antibody tests.

### COMPLICATIONS

- anaemia
- 2ry lactose intolerance
