# IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is a mixed group of abdominal symptoms for which no organic cause has been found.

Probably usually due to problems with intestinal motility or enhanced visceral perception - the 'brain-gut axis'.

There are various diagnostic criteria but they're not always helpful in practice because of the complex interplay between IBS and chronic pain syndromes.

### PREVALENCE

- 10-20%
- age of onset <40y
- F:M >2:1

### Dx

Often called a diagnosis of exclusion - nowadays try to make a positive diagnosis but also must exclude other dx.

Diagnose if:

	abdominal pain/discomfort relieved by defecation 
	OR 
	associated with altered stool form/frequency (constipation/diarrhoea may alternate)
	
	AND >2 of:
	
	- urgency
	- incomplete evacuation
	- abdo bloating/distension
	- mucous PR
	- worsening symptoms after food
	
Other symptoms:

- nausea
- bladder symptoms
- backache

Symptoms chronic (>6/12).

Exacerbated by stress, menstruation or gastroenteritis (post-infection IBS).

#### SIGNS

Exam often normal.

General abdo tenderness common.

#### INVESTIGATIONS

If hx classic, sufficient to do:

- FBC
- ESR
- CRP
- LFT
- coeliac serology

If >50y or there is any marker of organic disease (e.g. high temp, blood PR, weight loss) do **colonoscopy**.

If diarrhoea prominent:

- LFT
- stool culture
- B12/folate
- anti-endomysial Abs
- TSH
- consider referral ± barium follow-through ± rectal biopsy

Further investigation guided by symptoms e.g.:

- upper GI endoscopy (dyspepsia, reflux) or small bowel radiology (Crohn's)
- duodenal biopsy (coeliac disease)
- Giardia tests
- ERCP (e.g. chronic pancreatitis) or MRCP (active pancreatitis)
- excluding ovarian ca may need serum CA-125

#### REFERRAL

Low threshold of referral if FHx of ovarian or bowel ca. 

Refer if:

- dx unsure

- changing symptoms in 'known IBS'

- to surgeon if rectal mucosal prolapse

- to dietitian if food intolerance

- to psycho- or hypontherapist if stress/depression, refractory symptoms

- to gynaecologist if cyclical pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrheoa

- to dermatologist if co-existing atopy (3x more common in atopy)

- pain clinic if chronic pain overlap syndromes or detrusor problems

### MGMT

Rx rarely 50% successful so aim to reduce impact of symptoms with explanation and reassurance along with other things.

Encourage healthy diet.

Further rx depends on predominant symptoms.
