ALT and AST live in hepatic cells.

ALT and AST up = hepatitic injury.

ALT usually higher than AST.



If AST higher indicates alcoholic aetiology.

Gamma GT increased in isolation is clue of alcohol abuse.

High MCV indicates alcohol abuse.



ALP and Gamma GT are found in cells of biliary duct.

High ALP and gamma GT indicates cholestasis.

About 80% of drug-induced liver damage is cholestatic rather than hepatitic. e.g. co-amoxiclav.


Bilirubin

Albumin - made in liver so a test of liver synthetic function.

Clotting factors - also made in liver so test of liver synthetic function. INR can go up because of change in production of clotting factors in the liver.


Platelets can drop because liver disease can cause splenomegaly (because of portal hypertension) which increases the consumption of platelets.

LIVER SCREEN - done for anyone with deranged liver tests. Autoimmune, infective, inherited, AFP (malignancy).
