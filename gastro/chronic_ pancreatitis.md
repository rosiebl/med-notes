# CHRONIC PANCREATITIS

Pancreatits is defined by pancreatic inflammation.

Chronic pancreatitis is characterised by recurrent or persistent abdominal pain and **progressive injury** to the pancreas and surrounding structures, leading to scarring and **loss of function**.

Unlike recurrent acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis is characterised by:

- reduced pancreatic exocrine function
- malabsorption
- diabetes
- pancreatic calcifications


### CAUSES

Most common: alcohol.

Rare:

- familial
- CF
- haemochromatosis
- pancreatic duct obstruction (stones/tumour)
- high PTH
- congenital (pancreas divisum)

#### RISK FACTORS

Strong:

- alcohol
- smoking
- FHx
- coeliac disease

Weak:

- high-fat, high-protein diet
- tropical geography


#### ONSET

Peak age at presentation varies with aetiology:

- hereditary pancreatitis 10-14y
- juvenile idiopathic chronic pancreatitis 19-23y
- alcoholic chronic pancreatitis 36-44y
- senile idiopathic chronic pancreatitis 56-62y


### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

Symptoms relapse and worsen.

- epigastric pain 'boring' to the back

- bloating

- steatorrheoa

- weight loss

- brittle diabetes

Look out for erythema ab igne - mottled dusky grey rash from hot water bottle use for pain relief.


### INVESTIGATIONS

Ultrasound Â± CT: pancreatic calcifications confirm the dx.

MRCP + ERCP (risks acute attack).

AXR: speckled calcification.

High glucose.

Breath tests e.g. C-hiolien.

### TREATMENT

#### DRUGS

- analgesia

- lipase e.g. Creon

- fat-soluble vitamins

Insulin needs may be high or variable so bewahe hypoglycaemia.

#### DIET

No alcohol.

Low fat may help.

Can try medium chain triglycerides.

#### SURGERY

e.g. pancreatectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy (duct drainage procedure)

Indications:

- unremitting pain
- narcotic abuse (beware!)
- weight loss

### COMPLICATIONS

- psueodcyst

- diabetes

- biliary obstruction

- local arterial aneurysm

- splenic vein thrombosis

- gastric varices

- pancreatic carcinoma
