# CROHN'S DISEASE

Chronic inflammatory GI disease characterised by **transmural granulomatous inflammation** affecting any part of the gut from **mouth to anus**, with **skip lesions**.

Especially affects terminal ileus (70%) and proximal colon.

Skip lesions: unaffected bowel between areas of active disease.

### CAUSE

Cause unknown.

Mutations of NOD2/CARD15 gene increase risk.

Associations:

- altered cell mediated immunity
- smoking increases risk 3-4x (c.f. UC smoking decreases risk 3x)
- NSAIDs may exacerbate

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Prevalence: 0.5-1/1000; less if Asian.

F:M >1:1

Incidence: 5-10/100,000/yr

Bimodal age of onset: peaks 20-30y and 60-70y.

### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

Symptoms:

- diarrhoea and urgency ± blood in stool (less common that in UC)

- can also be bowel obstruction

- abdominal pain/tenderness

- weight loss/failure to thrive

- fever

- malaise

- anorexia

Signs:

- aphthous ulcerations

- abdominal tenderness/mass

- perianal abscess/fistulae/skin tags

- anal strictures

- clubbing

- skin problems

- joint problems

- eye problems


### INVESTIGATIONS

Blood

- FBC
- ESR
- CRP
- U&E
- LFT
- INR
- ferritin
- TIBC (total iron binding capacity)
- B12
- folate

Stool MC&S to exclude *Campylobacter, C difficile, Salmonella, Shigella, E coli*, amoebae.

Colonoscopy + rectal biopsy even if mucosa looks normal. 20% have microscopic granulomas.

Small bowel enema detects ileal disease.

Capsule endoscopy

MRI: can assess pelvic disease + fistulae. Small bowel MRI assess disease activity and shows stricture locations.

Ba enema: cobblestoning, 'rose thorn' ulcers ± colon strictures (rarely used, colonscopy preferred).

### COMPLICATIONS

GI complcations:

- small bowel obstruction
- toxic dilatation (rarer than in UC)
- abscess formation
	- abdominal
	- pelvic
	- ischiorectal
- rectal haemorrhage
- fistulae (10%)
	- colovesical
	- colovaginal
	- perianal
	- enterocutaneous
- perforation
- colon cancer

Other complications:

- fatty liver
- primary sclerosing cholangitis
- cholangiocarcinoma
- renal stones
- osteomalacia
- malnutrition
- amyloidosis

### MANAGE

- daily bloods ± AXR
	- FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E
- consider transfusion if Hb <90-100g/LMENT

Lifestyle:

- quit smoking
- optimise nutrition

Rx options:

- 5-ASAs (efficacy in Crohn's unproven)
- steroids
- immunosuppressants
- TNF inhibitors
- antibiotics
- diet/supplements

#### MILD ATTACKS

Symptomatic but systemically well.

Prednisolone on decreasing dose for ~6/52.

#### SEVERE ATTACKS

Looks ill.

Admit for:

- nil by mouth
- IV steroids
- IV rehydration

Treat rectal disease:

- steroids
- metronidazole helps, esp. in perianal disease or superadded infection

Monitor temp, pulse, BP + stool frequency/character and examine daily.

Daily FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E + AXR.

Consider transfusion if Hb <90-100g/L and parenteral nutrition.

If improving after 5d, transfer to prednisolone PO.

If no improvement, consider infliximab and adalimumab, esp. in fistulizing Crohn's.

Consider abdo sepsis complicating Crohn's, esp. if have abdo pain. Assess with US/CT/MRI.
 
#### PERIANAL DISEASE

Occurs in ~50%.

Rx includes: 

- oral abx
- immunosuppressant rx ± infliximab
- local surgery ± seton insertion

#### SURGERY

50-80% need 1 or more op in their life.

Never cures.

Indications:

- drug failure (most common)
- GI obstrction from stricture
- perforation
- fistulae
- abscess

Surgical aims:

1. to defunction (rest) distal disease, e.g. with temporary ileostomy
2. resection of the worst areas - but remember short bowel syndrome

Bypass and pouch not done in Crohn's because of icnreased risk of recurrence.

#### ADDITIONAL RX

Azathioprine can be used as a steroid-sparing agent.

Methotrexate.

Abx e.g. rifaximin may give remission.

IV immunoglobulin.

Nutrition e.g. elemental diet.

TNF-alpha inhibitors can decrease disease activity.

### PROGNOSIS

Poor prognosis if:

- age <30y
- steroids needed at 1st presentation
- perianal disease
- diffuse small bowel disease
