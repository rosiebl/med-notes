# OESOPHAGEAL VARICES

Varices may be found in the stomach, around the umbilicus and in the rectum. 

### PATHOGENESIS

- progressive liver fibrosis + regenerative nodules produce contractile elements in the liver's vascular bed

- portal hypertension

- splanchnic vasodilation

- increased cardiac output

- salt and water retention

- hyperdynamic circulation/increased portal flow

- formation of collaterals between portal + systemic systems e.g. in lower oesophagus + gastric cardia

- gastro-oesophageal varices develop once portal pressure >10mmHg

- if >12mmHg variceal bleeding may be brisk

- death (more likely if clotting problems + cirrhosis)


### PROGNOSIS

6-week mortality depends on severity of liver disease, e.g. Child A ~0%, Child C ~30%.

Rebleeding common and worse with large varices.

### VARICEAL BLEED PROPHYLAXIS

(See notes GI bleeding for management of bleeds)

#### PRIMARY

~30% of cirrhotics with varices bleed. 

Can be reduced to 15% by:

- non-selective beta-blockade e.g. propanolol

- repeat endoscopic banding ligation

Endocopic sclerotherapy not sued because risks (strictures) outweigh benefits.


#### SECONDARY

After 1st variceal bleed, 60% rebleed within 1y.

Options are as above + transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) for varices resistant to banding.

Surgical shunt if TIPS not possible for technical reasons.
