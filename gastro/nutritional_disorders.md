# NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

See also: notes on Vitamin C, D and zinc deficiency.

For full list of deficiency syndromes

### BERIBERI

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency.

- inadequate dietary intake
- decreased GI absorption
- impaired utilisation of thiamine 

Wet beriberi: heart failure + general oedema.

Dry beriberi: neuropathy --> Wernicke's encephalopathy.

### WERNICKE'S ENCEPHALOPATHY

Always consider dx in alcoholics.

#### SYMPTOMS 

Classical triad:

1. confusion
2. ataxia - wide-based gait
3. ophthalmoplegia - nystagmus, lateral rectus or conjugate gaze palsies

May also present with:

- memory disturbance
- hypotension
- hypothermia
- reduced consciousness

#### CAUSES

Thiamine deficiency leading to focal areas of brain damage, including periaqueductal punctate haemorrhages.

Recognised causes:

- chronic alcoholism
- eating disorders
- malnutrition
- prolonged vomiting e.g. chemotherapy, GI malignancy, hyperemesis gravidarum

Dx mainly clinical.

Red cell transketolase low but rarely done.

#### KORSAKOFF'S SYNDROME

Hypothalamic damage + cerebral atrophy due to thimaine deficiency. 

May accompany Wernicke's encephalopathy.

- decreased ability to create new memories
- confabulation: invented memories due to retrograde amnesia
- lack of insight + apathy


#### TREATMENT

Urgent replacement to prevent irreverisble Korsakoff's syndrome.

	--> Thiamine 2 pairs high-potency ampules IV/IM/8h over 30 mins for 2 days
	--> oral supplementation until no longer at risk

If pt has coexisting hypoglycaemia (common) give thiamine before glucose as Wernicke's can be precipitated by glucose administration to thimaine-deficient pt.

#### PROGNOSIS

Untreated: death in 20%

Korsakoff's psychosis in 85% - quarter need long-term institutional care.

### PELLAGRA

Nicotinic acid deficiency.

Classic triad:

- Diarrhoea
- Dementia
- Dermatitis (Casal's necklace)

May also have:

- neuropathy
- depression
- insomnia
- tremor
- rigidity
- ataxiafits

May occur in carcinoid syndrome + anti-TB drugs (isoniazid).

Endemic in China and Africa.

Rx:

- education
- electrolyte replacement
- nicotinamide

### XEROPTHALMIA

Vitamin A deficiency.

Big cause of blindness around the world (less in high income countries).

Conjunctivae dry and develop round/triangular spots.

Cornes cloudy and soft.

Give Vitamin A. Special help if pt pregnant.
