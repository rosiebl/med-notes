# GI BLEEDING

**Haematemesis:** vomiting of blood. May be bright red or look like coffee grounds.

**Melaena:** black motions, often like tar, with characteristic smell.

### CAUSES

(See other notes for more detail on causes)

#### COMMON

- peptic ulcers

- Mallory-Weiss tear: persistent vomiting/retching causes oesophageal mucosal tear 

- oesophageal varices

- gastritis/gastric erosions

- oesophagitis

- duodenitis

- malignancy

- drugs
	- NSAIDs
	- aspirin
	- steroids
	- thrombolytics
	- anticoagulants

Or no obvious cause.

#### RARE

- bleeding disorders

- portal hypertensive gastropathy

- aorto-enteric fistula

- angiodysplasia

- haemobilia: bleeding into biliary tree

- Dieulafoy lesion: rupture of unusually big arteriole

- Meckel's diverticulum: distal ileum contains embryonic gastric + pancreatic tissue, may secrete gastric acid and cause pain + bleeding

- Peutz-Jegher's syndrome: autosomal dominant causing multiple GI polyps + more

- Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome: heriditary telangiectasia of skin and mucous membrnes causing GI bleeds


### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

- haematemesis or melaena

- dizziness, especially postural

- fainting

- abdominal pain

- dysphagia?

- hypotension, may only be postural in young

- tachycardia, not if on beta blocker

- decreased JVP

- decreased urine output

- cool and clammy

- signs of chronic liver disease
	- e.g. telangiectasia, purpura, jaundice (biliary colic + jaundice + melaena suggests haemobilia)

Ask about previous GI problems, drug use, alcohol.

### CLASSIFICATION

#### ROCKALL SCORE

Helps to predict risk of rebleeding and mortality.

Initial Rockall score, pre-endoscopy:

Pre-endoscopy | 0 pts | 1 pts | 2 pts | 3 pts
------|-----|-----|-----|-----
Age | <60y | 60-79y | >80y | 
Shock: systolic BP and HR | BP >100mmHg, HR <100/min | BP >100mmHg, HR >100/min | BP <100mmHg 
Comorbidity | Nil major | Heart failure; ischaemic heart disease | Renal failure; liver failure | Metastases

Final Rockall score, post-endoscopy:

Post-endoscopy | 0 pts | 1 pts | 2 pts | 3 pts
------|-----|-----|-----|-----
Diagnosis | Mallory-Weiss tear; no lesion; no sign of recent bleeding | All other diagnoses | Upper GI malignancy
Signs of recent haemorrhage on endoscopy | None, or dark red spot | | Blood in upper GI tract; adherent clot; visible vessel

Less than 3 means excellent prognosis.

More than 8 means high risk of death.

Initial Rockall score >3 or final Rockall score >6 said to be an indication for surgery but decision based on multiple clinical factors.


### MANAGEMENT

Follow guidelines for shock if relevant.

If haemodynamically stable, consider transfusion if blood loos >30% circulating volume.

Consider CVP line for high risk pts e.g. old, CV disease, on beta blockers.

##### ENDOSCOPY

Within 4h if suspect variceal bleeding.

Within 12-24h if shocked on admission or significant comorbidity.

Can be used to identify bleeding, estimate risk of rebleeding and give treatment.

##### VARICEAL BLEEDING

	Resuscitate, ?transfuse if anaemic till Hb = 80g/L
	
	Correct clotting abnormalities
	
	Give terlipressin 2mg SC QDS (caution in peptic ulcer disease)

	Urgent endoscopy for banding or sclerotherapy

	If massive bleed/bleeding continues, pass Sengstaken-Blakemore tube for balloon tamponade
	
Bleed is equivalent of large protein meal so start rx to avoid hepatic encephalopathy.

Omeprazole 40mg PO may help prevent stress ulcer.

##### INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY

Contact surgical team at outset.

- severe bleeding OR bleeding despite transfusing 6U in >60y (8U if <60)

- active or uncontrollable bleeding at endoscopy - or rebleeding

- initial Rockall score >3 or final Rockall score >6.


##### ACUTE DRUG THERAPY

For pts with major ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic rx:

- omeprazole OR pantoprazole (80mg stat IV over 5 mins, then 8mg/h for 72h)

##### H. PYLORI

Check status in all pts and eradicte if +.



### REBLEEDING

40% rebleeders die of complications.

Identify high risk patients and monitor closely.

IVI of omeprazole has preventative role.

**Signs of rebleed (inform surgeon immediately):**

- rising pulse rate

- falling JP Â± decreasing hourly urine output

- haematemesis or melaena

- fall in BP (late + sinister finding) and decreased consciousness level
