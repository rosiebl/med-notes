# LIVER TRANSPLANTATION

### ACUTE LIVER FAILURE

**KCH liver transplant criteria**: fulfilling these criteria predicts poor outcome in acute liver failure.

	Paracetamol-induced liver failure	
	
	- arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion
	
	OR all of the following:
	
	- prothrombin time >100s
	- creatinine >300 micromol/L
	- grade III or IV encephalopathy
	
-
	
	Non-paracetamol liver failure
	
	- prothrombin time >100s
	
	OR 3 out of 5 of the following:
	
	- drug-induced liver failure
	- age <10 or >40y
	- >1wk from 1st jaundice to encephalopathy
	- prothrombin time >50s
	- bilirubin >300 micromol/L

Transplants are cadaveric (heart-beating or non-heart-beating) or living (R lobe).

Refer earlier rather than later e.g. when ascites is refractory or after a 1st episode of bacterial peritonitis.

Contraindications:

- active sepsis
- decreased life expectancy (~ less than 2y) from concurrent diseases
- psychosocial factors precluding immunosuppression
