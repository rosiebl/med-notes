# ANAL CONDITIONS

Includes: 

- **fissure**

- **fistula**

- **abscess**

- **haemorrhoids**

- pruritis ani

- haemotoma

- pilonidal sinus

- prolapse

- warts

- ulcers

- skin tags




### FISSURE-IN-ANO

Painful tear in the squamous lining of the lower anal canal.

If chronic often has a 'sentinel pile' or mucosal tag at the external aspect.

90% posterior.

**Causes**:

- usually hard faeces

- rare: syphilis, herpes, trauma, Crohn's, anal cancer, psoriasis

Groin nodes suggest complicating factor e..g immunosuppressive/HIV+.

**Rx**:

- 5% lidocaine ointment + GTN ointment *or* topical diltiazem 2%.

- increase dietary fibre

- fluids Â± stool softener and hygiene advice

- 2nd line: botulinum injection + topical diltiazem (as effective as GTN with fewer side effects)
	
- surgical options include lateral partial internal sphincterotomy

### FISTULA-IN-ANO

Track communicates between the skin and anal canal/rectum.

**Causes**:

- perianal sepsis

- abscesses

- Crohn's disease

- TB

- diverticular disease

- rectal carcinoma

- immunocompromise

NB. Blockage of deep intramuscular gland ducts thought to predispose to abscess --> discharge to form fistula.
se

**Tests**: MRI, endoanal US scan.

**Goodsall's rule**: if anterior, fistula track is a stright line (radial). If posterior, track opening is always at 6 o'clock position.

**Rx**:

- fistulotomy + excision
- high fistulae: involve continence muscles of anus
	- Seton suture drains and is tightened over time to maintain continence
- low fistulae
	-'laid open' to heal by 2ry intention
	- division is no risk to continence

### ANORECTAL ABSCESSES

Usually caused by gut organisms - rarely staphs or TB.

F:M ~ 8:1

Locations:

- perianal 45%
- ischiorectal <30%
- intersphincteric >20%
- supraelevator ~5%

**Associations**:

- diabetes

- Crohn's

- malignancy

- fistulae

**Rx**: incise and drain under GA.


### HAEMORRHOIDS

Haemorrhoids (piles) are disrupted and dilated anal cushions.

Anal cushions are discontinuous spongy vascular tissue in the anal canal, attached by smooth muscle and elastic tissue. They may become bulky and loose and protrude.

Cushions protrude --> become more congested and hypertrophy --> protrude more readily --> may strangulate.

Classification of haemorrhoids:

- 1st degree: remain in rectum
- 2nd degree: prolapse through anus on defecation but spontaneously reduce
- 3rd degree: as 2nd but require digital reduction
- 4th degree: remain persistently prolapsed

**Causes**: 

- key factor is constipation with prolonged straining

- bowel habit may be normal

- in minority of cases: congestion from pelvic tumour, pregnancy, CCF, portal HTN

**Symptoms**:

- bright red rectal bleeding
- often coats stools, on tissue or dripping after defecation
- ?mucous discharge
- ?pruritis ani
- severe anaemia may occur

Weight loss/tenesmus/change in bowel habit prompts other thoughts.

**DDx**:

- perianal haemotoma
- anal fissure
- abscess
- tumour
- proctalgia fugax


**Rx**:

Medical e.g. increase fluid + fibre, topical analgesics, stool softener, topical steroids. *1st degree.*

Non-surgical e.g. rubber band ligation, sclerosants, infre-red coagulation. *2nd + 3rd degree + refractory 1st degree.*

Surgical e.g. excisional haemorrhoidectomy, stapled haemorrhoidopexy. 

Prolapsed, thrombosed piles treated with: analgesia, ice packs, stool softener.

### PRURITIS ANI

**Causes**: moisture/soiling, fissures, incontinence, poor hygiene, tight pants, threadworm, fistula, dermatoses, lichen sclerosus, anxiety, contact dermatitis.

**Rx**: careful hygiene, anaesthetic cream, moist wipes, no spicy food, no steroid/antibiotic cream.

### PERIANAL HAEMATOMA

Clotted venous saccule appearing as 'dark blueberry' under skin at anal margin. 

Exacuate under LA or may resovle spontaneously.

### PILONIDAL SINUS

Obstruction of natal cleft hair follicles ~6cm above anus --> ingrowing hair --> foreign body reaction -->  abscesses and secondary tracts.

Rx: excision and closure of tracks, ?abx.

### RECTAL PROLAPSE

Mucosa or all layers of rectum protrude through anus. 75% with incontinence. 

Due to lax sphincter, prolonged strinaing, related to chronic neuro and psych disorders.  

Rx surgical.

### PROCTALGIA FUGAX

Idiopathic, intense, brief, stabbing/cramping rectal pain. Often worse at night.

Reassurance + inhaled salbutamol or topical GTN or diltiazem may help.

### ANAL ULCERS

Rare: consider Crohn's disease, anal cancer, TB and syphilis.
