#  DYSPEPSIA

Dyspepsia: group of symptoms - pain in upper GI tract. 3 types:

- gastro-oesophageal reflux-related dyspepsia
	- burning pain
	- radiates upwards
	- oesophagitis
- peptic ulcer-related dyspepsia
	- dull pain constantly there
- non-specific/idiopathic/functional dyspepsia 
	- can have symptoms quite similar to IBD

Rule out red flags for gastric cancer:

- weight loss
- energy levels
- investigate problems swallowing/possible obstruction

H pylori - related to gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma.

Duodenal ulcers - 100% Helicobacter pylori.

Gastric ulcers - ~80% Helicobacter pylori.

H pylori tests:

- serology (useful for dx but remains positive after treatment)
- nitrogen breath test
- stool sample antigen test - comparable sensitivity and specificity to breath test, and antigen disappears after treatment so can use to check eradication
- endoscopy - biopsy and test sample in aliquot for colour change

Rennie's - brand name for ranitidine, H2-antagonist. Ranitidine used to be gold standard for ulcer treatment, before omeprazole. Now used when pts can't tolerate PPIs. Rennie's is 75mg but to treat a peptic ulcer you need 300mg so not very helpful for these pts.

Bad reflux can trigger asthma.

Important ddx:

- angina
	- pain worse after exercise?
	- risk factors - age, high cholesterol, blood pressure, smoker, alcohol?
- biliary dyspepsia
- pancreatitis
