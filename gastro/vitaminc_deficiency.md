# VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY

Scurvy is a life-threatening condition caused by Vitamin C deficiency, which features bleeding from the gums, poor wound healing, perifollicular ecchymoses, haemarthroses and joint pain.

Diagnosis is often delayed because of slow identification of the disease or incomplete diet history.


### EPIDEMIOLOGY

People usually affected are refugees or victims of famines, alcoholics, older people, fad dieters, childern with autism or idisoyncratic behavioural difficulties.

Other at risk groups are smokers, low-income people, and people with psychiatric or other underlying medical conditions.


### CAUSE AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Cause: always due to insufficient dietary intake.

NB. Vitamin C intake may be surprisingly low in people with a seemingly good diet, e.g. frozen peas have much less Vitamin C than fresh.

Vitamin C is essential for **collagen synthesis**. Insufficient collagen replacement causes blood vessels to lose their integrity and become leaky:

- perivascular oedema
- erythrocyte extravasation
- frank haemorrhage

Vitamin C is an essential electron donor for pathways for noradrenaline synthesis, amidation of peptide hormones and tyrosine metabolism.

#### RISK FACTORS

Strong:

- famine and refugee populations
- infants taking only cow's milk
- smoking
- surgery
- sepsis
- HIV
- critical illness
- ARDS
- pancreatitis

Weak:

- older people
- living alone
- psychiatric disorders
- alcoholism
- dementia
- low income
- faddist diet
- poor dentition or masticatory inefficiency
- autistic spectrum disorder
- static encephalopathies of childhood
- end stage renal disease and/or haemodialysis dependence
- graft versus host disease (GVHD)


### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

Signs:

1. Listlessness, anorexia, cachexia
2. Gingivitis, loose teeth, halitosis
3. Bleeding from gums, nose, hair follicles, or into joints, bladder, gut
4. Muscle pain/weakness
5. Oedema
