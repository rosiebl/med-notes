# ULCERATIVE COLITIS

Relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa.

Characterisitcally affects the rectum and spreads proximally to affect variable lengths of the colon.

- proctitis (only rectum) = 50%
- left-sided colitis = ~30%
- pancolitis (entire colon) = ~20%

Should never spread proximal to the ileocaecal valve (apart from backwash ileitis).

Cause unknown. Some genetic susceptibility.


### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Prevalence = 100-200 per 100,000

Incidence = 10-20 per 100,000 per yr

F:M >1:1

Most people present aged 15-30y.

UC is 3x more common in non-smokers (opposite to Crohn's) - symptoms may relapse on quitting smoking.

### PATHOLOGY

Hyperaemic/haemorrhagic granular colonic mucosa ± pseudopolyps formed by inflammation.

Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria.

Inflamamtion normally not transmural.

(hyperaemic = increased blood flow; punctate = studded with tiny dots or holes)

See biopsy for histology.

### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

##### SYMPTOMS

- episodic or chronic diarrhoea ± blood/mucous

- crampy abdominal discomfort

- urgency/tenesmus ~= rectal UC

- systemic symptoms in attacks
	- fever
	- malaise
	- anorexia
	- weight loss


Bowel frequency relates to severity.

##### SIGNS

May be none.

In acute, severe UC there may be:

- fever

- tachycardia

- tender distended abdomen

Extra-abdominal signs:

- clubbing

- aphthous oral ulcers

- erythema nodosum

- pyoderma gangrenosum

- conjunctivitis

- episcleritis

- iritis

- large joint arthritis

- ankylosing spondylitis

- fatty liver

- primary sclerosing cholangitis

- cholangiocarcinoma

- nutritional deficits

- amyloidosis
