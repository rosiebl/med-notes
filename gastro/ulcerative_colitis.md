# ULCERATIVE COLITIS

Relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa.

Characterisitcally affects the rectum and spreads proximally to affect variable lengths of the colon.

- proctitis (only rectum) = 50%
- left-sided colitis = ~30%
- pancolitis (entire colon) = ~20%

Should never spread proximal to the ileocaecal valve (apart from backwash ileitis).

Cause unknown. Some genetic susceptibility.


### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Prevalence = 100-200 per 100,000

Incidence = 10-20 per 100,000 per yr

F:M >1:1

Most people present aged 15-30y.

UC is 3x more common in non-smokers (opposite to Crohn's) - symptoms may relapse on quitting smoking.

### PATHOLOGY

Hyperaemic/haemorrhagic granular colonic mucosa ± pseudopolyps formed by inflammation.

Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria.

Inflamamtion normally not transmural.

(hyperaemic = increased blood flow; punctate = studded with tiny dots or holes)

See biopsy for histology.

### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

##### SYMPTOMS

- episodic or chronic diarrhoea ± blood/mucous

- crampy abdominal discomfort

- urgency/tenesmus ~= rectal UC

- systemic symptoms in attacks
	- fever
	- malaise
	- anorexia
	- weight loss


Bowel frequency relates to severity.

##### SIGNS

May be none.

In acute, severe UC there may be:

- fever

- tachycardia

- tender distended abdomen

Extra-abdominal signs:

- clubbing

- aphthous oral ulcers

- erythema nodosum

- pyoderma gangrenosum

- conjunctivitis

- episcleritis

- iritis

- large joint arthritis

- ankylosing spondylitis

- fatty liver

- primary sclerosing cholangitis

- cholangiocarcinoma

- nutritional deficits

- amyloidosis



### INVESTIGATIONS

Blood:

- FBC
- ESR
- CRP
- U&E
- LFT
- blood culture

Stool MC&S to exclude *Campylobacter, C difficile, Salmonella, Shigella, E coli*, amoebae.

AXR:

- no faecal shadows
- mucosal thickening/islands
- colonic dilatation

Erect CXR: air under diaphragm indicates perforation.

Ba enema: never do during severe attacks or for dx.

#### Colonoscopy

Shows disease extent and allows biopsy.

On biopsy look for:

- inflammatory infiltrate
- goblet cell depletion
- glandular distortion
- mucosal ulcers
- crypt abscesses

### CLASSIFICATION

Variable | Mild UC | Moderate UC | Severe UC
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Motions/day | <4 | 4-6 | >6
Rectal bleeding | small | moderate | large
Temp at 6AM | apyrexial | 37.1-37.8 | >37.8
Resting pulse | <70 bpm | 70-90 bpm | >90 bpm
Haemoglobin | >110 g/L | 105-110 g/L | <105 g/L
ESR (do CRP too) | <30 (<16 may be better) | | >30 (or CRP >45 mg.L)

### COMPLICATIONS

Perforation

Bleeding

Toxic dilatation of the colon: mucosal islands + colonic diameter >6cm.

VTE: prophylaxis for all inpatients.

Increased risk of colon cancer: 

- pancolitis for 20 years --> ~15% risk of colon cancer
- intra-epithelial neoplasms may occur in flat normal-looking mucosa
	- surveillance colonscopy done to spot these
	- 2-4y with 4 random biopsies/10cm

### MANAGEMENT

#### INDUCING REMISSION

Mild UC

- **5-ASA**s are mainstay of remission induction/maintenance
	- sulfasalazine, mesalazine, olsalazine
- **steroids** help remission induction
	- prednisolone PO ± steroid foams PR
	- prednisolone retention enemas
- if improving after 2 weeks, decrease steroid dose
- if not, treat as moderate UC

Moderate UC

- 4-6 motions/day but otherwise well
- 6 weeks prednisolone PO (decreasing dose) + 5-ASA + steroid enemas
- if no improvement after 2 weeks treat as severe UC

Severe UC

- if unwell and >6 motions/day
- admit for NBM and IV rehydration
- IV hydrocortisone + rectal steroids
- monitor temp, pulse, BP + stool frequency/character
- twice daily exam
- daily bloods ± AXR
	- FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E
- consider transfusion if Hb <90-100g/L
- parenteral nutrition rarely required
- if improving in 5d transfer to prenisolone PO and 5-ASA

If on day 3 CRP >45 or >6 stools per day, action probably needed. e.g. colectomy or rescue rx with ciclosporin or infliximab.


See handbook for doses.



#### TOPICAL RX

Proctitis may respond to suppositories - prednislone or mesalazine.

Topical 5-ASAs better than topical steroids.

Procto-sigmoiditis may respond to steroid foam PR.

Retention enemas may be needed in L sided colitis.

#### SURGERY

Needed at some point in 20%.

e.g. proctocolectomy + terminal ileostomy. May retain ileocaecal calve to reduce liquid loss.

Colectomy with ileo-anal pouch later. 

Pouchitis may improve with abx and immunosuppressants.

#### IMMUNOMODULATION

If no remission with steroids, or if prolonged use required, move to immunomodulation.

Agents:

- azathioprine
- methotrexate
- infliximab
- adalimumab
- calcineurin inhibitors w.g. tacrolimus

#### MAINTAINING REMISSION

Maintenance continues for life.

Sulfasalzine is 1st line.

Side effects relate to sulfapyridine intolerance: 

- headache
- nausea
- anorexia
- increased temperature
- rash
- haemolysis hepatitis
- pancreatitis
- paradoxical worsening of colitis
- reversible oligospermia

Newer 5-ASAs: good at maintaining remission and have fewer side effects but are more expensive. Indicated in sulfasalazine intolerance and in young men where fertility is a concern. e.g. mesalazine.
