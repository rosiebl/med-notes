# COPD SEVERITY

Stage 1 MILD: FEV1 >80% of predicted

Stage 2 MODERATE: FEV1 50-79% of predicted

Stage 3 SEVERE: FEV1 30-49% of predicted

Stage 4 VERY SEVERE: FEV1 <30% of predicted

Disability in COPD can be poorly reflected by FEV1 - more complete assessment includes degree of airflow obstruction and disability, frequency of exacerbations and following known prognostic factors:

- FEV1
- TLCO
- brethlessness (MRC scale)
- health status
- exercise capacity e.g. 6 minute walk test
- BMI
- PaO2
- cor pulmonale

e.g. can use BODE index - BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise capacity.
