# ABBREVIATED MENTAL TEST SCORE

	Screening questionnaire for cognitive impairment.

1. Tell patient address to recall at the end

6. Date of birth

2. Age

4. What year is it?

3. Time (to nearest hour)

9. Where are you now?

5. Recognise 2 people, e.g. doctor + nurse

7. Dates of WW2

8. Name of current monarch/prime minister

10. Count backwards from 20 to 1

11. (Recall adress from beginning)

[This is different to the official order of questions but is more intuitive].

Score of <6 suggests poor cognition: acute (delirium) or chronic (dementia).

Correlates well with MMSE.

Remember, patients who are deaf, dysphasic, depressed, uncooperative or whose first language is not English will also get low scores.
