# CKD STAGING

Classification of renal impairment in CKD is based on presence of kidney damage and GFR, irrespective of dx.

One reason to classify is to motivate secondary prevention, e.g. to 'mandate' ACEi or ARB if BP >140/85, esp if proteinuria present or stage >3.

Stage | GFR (mL/min) | Notes
-- | -- | --
1 | >90 | normal or raised GFR with other evidence of renal damage
2 | 60-89 | slight decrease in GFR with other evidence of renal damage 
3A | 45-59 | moderate decrease in GFR ± evidence of other renal damage
3B | 30-44 | moderate decrease in GFR ± evidence of other renal damage
4 | 15-29 | severe decrease in GFR ± evidence of renal damage
5 | <15 | established renal failure

N.B. **evidence of other renal damage** is proteinuria, haematuria or evidence of abnormal anatomy or systemic disease.
