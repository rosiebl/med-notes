# ROCKALL SCORE

	For GI bleeding, to predict risk of rebleeding and mortality.

The Rockall score incorporates pre- and post-endoscopy findings. For best results the full score (x/11) should be used.


Pre-endoscopy | 0 pts | 1 pts | 2 pts | 3 pts
------|-----|-----|-----|-----
Age | <60y | 60-79y | >80y | 
Shock: systolic BP and HR | BP >100mmHg, HR <100/min | BP >100mmHg, HR >100/min | BP <100mmHg 
Comorbidity | Nil major | Heart failure; ischaemic heart disease | R
Diagnosis | Mallory-Weiss tear; no lesion; no sign of recent bleeding | All other diagnoses | Upper GI malignancy
Signs of recent haemorrhage on endoscopy | None, or dark red spot | | Blood in upper GI tract; adherent clot; visible vessel

Less than 3 means excellent prognosis.

More than 8 means high risk of death.

Initial Rockall score >3 (using pre-endoscopy findings of age, shock + comorbidity) or final Rockall score >6 said to be an indication for surgery but decision based on multiple clinical factors.
