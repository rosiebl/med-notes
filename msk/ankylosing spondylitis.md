# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

Chronic progressive inflammatory arthropathy predominantly affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints.

Seronegative inflammatory arthritis.

Mainly affects the axial skeleton but peripheral joints, entheses, and extra-articular sites e.g. eyes and bowels can be affected.

### EPIDEMIOLOGY
Prevalence 0.25-1%.

Men present earlier: at 16yo M:F ~6:1. At 30yo M:F ~2:1.

~90% HLAB27+. Heritability of 97%.

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Not just inflammation and  erosion as in RA.

AS involves:

- inflammation
- cartilage erosion
- repair - ossification

### CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Mainly affects axial skeleton.

Gradual onset low back pain.

Morning stiffness, better with activity.

1st symptom is usually sacroilitis, presents as buttock pain, sometimes alternating side. Radiates down leg, but not below the knee - this indicates sciatica. (Also more of a dull ache than a shooting nerve pain like sciatica).

Progressive loss of spinal movement - causes decreased thoracic expansion.

Some progress to kyphosis, neck hyperextension and spino-cranial ankylosis.

Can affect other joints: asymmetrical, affects large joints - hip, knee, ankle, wrist.

Enthesitis - inflammation at the insertion of a tendon. Usually:

- Achilles tendonitis
- plantar fasciitis
- at tibial and ischial tuberosities
- at iliac crests
- can get chest pain from costochondritis - enthesitis in the chest

Acute iritis: 1/3 pts, may lead to blindness if untreated.

Other associations:

- osteoporosis - up to 60%
- aortic valve incompetence - <3%
- pulmonary apical fibrosis

### DIAGNOSIS

Dx is clinical, supported by imaging.

MRI most sensitive, better for early disease.

Pelvic Xray:

- sacroiliitis is earliest xray feature
- irregularities/erosions/sclerosis
- lower half of sacroiliac joints, espeically iliac side

Vertebral syndesmophytes are characteristic: bony proliferations due to enthesitis between ligaments and vertebrae. Often initially T11-L1.

--> syndesmophytes fuse with vertebral body above, causing ankylosis 

--> later calcification of ligaments with ankylosis causes bamboo spine appearance

Other:

- FBC - normocytic anaemia
- increased ESR and CRP
- HLA B27 +ve (not diagnostic)


DDx:

- osteoarthritis
- diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis
- psoriatic arthritis
- reactive arthritis
- IBD-related arthritis
- infection
- vertebral fracture
- bony metastases

### MANAGEMENT

Exercise, not rest for back ache: **physiotherapy** to maintain posture, flexibility and mobility.

**NSAIDs**: usually relieve symptoms within 48h, may slow radiographic progression.

**TNF alpha blockers** in severe active AS if NSAIDs fail:

- etanercept
- adalimumab
- golimumab

**Local steroid injections** - temporary relief.

**Surgery**: hip replacement to improve pain/mobility, rarely spinal osteotomy.

Manage risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

### PROGNOSIS

Not always a clear relationship between the activity of arthritis and severity of underlying inflammation (as for all the spondyloarthritides). 

Prognosis worse if:

- ESR >30
- onset <16yrs
- early hip involvement
- poor response to NSAIDs
