# COMPARTMENT SYNDROME

Compartment syndrome is a pathological condition characterised by elevated interstitial pressure in a closed osseofascial compartment resulting in microvascular compromise, i.e. restriction of capillary blood flow.

Commonly involves compartments which have relatively non-compliant osseous or fascial structures, e.g.:

- anterior and deep posterior compartments of leg
- volar compartment of forearm

Compartment pressures >30-40 mmHg or within 10-30 mmHg of diastolic BP cause significant muscle damage.

## CAUSES

Common causes of acute compartment syndrome:

- fractures
- soft-tissue injury
- vascular compromise due to trauma
- extermity compression
- reperfusion of chronically ischaemic extremities
- burn injuries to extremities

Can also be associated with:

- IV fluid extravasation
- aggressive fluid resuscitation
- laproscopic colorectal surgery due to prolonged Lloyd-Davis operating position w exaggerated Trendelenburg tilt

Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is most common among long-distance runners.

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Can be caused by haemorrhage within the compartment or direct trauma to the muscles. 

--> causes subsequent oedema

--> can lead to increased pressure to above capillary level

--> restricts capillary flow

Muscle necrosis can occur even in apparently normal circulation if intracompartmental pressure is >30 mmHg for >8h.

## DIAGNOSIS

Key dx factors:

- presence of risk factors
- loss of muscle function

Other dx factors:

- pain
- pressure/tightness
- parasthesia
- pulselessness
- pallor
- paralysis

Risk factors:

- trauma
- bleeding disorder
- compression support
- thermal injury
- intense muscular activity

Also:

- extravasation of IV infusion
- venous obstruction

### TESTS

Compartment pressure measurement.

Serum creatine kinase elevated.

Urine myoglobin elevated.


## MANAGEMENT

Immediately release casts or occlusive dressings, paddings or circumferential dressings.

If that doesn't releive symptoms:, need urgent fasciotomy.

Complete fasciotomy of all compartments with elevated pressures.

If performed within 6 hours leads to lower related amputation or death.

If there is evidence of compartment syndrome >8h with absence of muscle function in neurologically intact limb then consider primary amputation.
