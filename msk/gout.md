# GOUT

Inflammatory arthritis associated with hyperuricaemia and intra-articular sodium urate crystals.

____________________

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Increasing prevalence in developing countries due to diet: purine-rich foods, high saturated fats, fructose containing drinks and alcohol.

1.4% in UK, with age increasing to 7% in men and 3% in women.

Gout M>F 4:1 - uric acid levels higher in men.

85-90% idiopathic.

Most people with hyperuricaemia are asymptomatic.

Osteoarthritic joints more prone to gout.

Serum uric acid levels increase with:

- age
- obesity
- western diet
- combined hyperlipidaemia, 
- diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, HTN (metabolic syndrome)

### PATHOGENSIS

Causes of gout:

- hereditary
- increased dietary purines
- alcohol exces
- diuretics
- leukaemia
- cytotoxics (tumour lysis)

Associations - gout is a marker for these so investigate:

- CVD
- HTN
- DM
- chronic renal failure

~90% people with gout have impaired excretion of uric acid. 10% have increased production.

Gout also appears to be autoinflammatory.

Causes of hyperuricaemia:

—> Impaired excretion of uric acid
	
- chronic renal disease
- drug therapy e.g. thiazide diuretics, low-dose aspirin
- hypertension
- lead toxicity
- primary hyperparathyroidism or hypothyroidism
- increased lactic acid production from alcohol, exercise, starvation
- glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency

—> Increased production of uric acid 

- increased purine synthesis de novo due to:
	- HGPRT reduction
	- phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate synthase overactivity
	- glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency with glycogen storage disease type 1
- increased turnover of purines due to:
	- myeloproliferative disorders e.g. polycythaemia vera
	- lymphoproliferative disorders e.g. leukaemia
	- others e.g. carcinoma, severe psoriasis

### TYPES OF GOUT PRESENTATION

50% in MTP joint of big toe.

Other joints: ankle, foot, small joints of the hand, wrist, elbow or knee. Can be polyarticular.

#### —> ACUTE GOUT

Presents typically with:

- sudden onset agonising pain
- swelling
- redness
- in 1st MTP joint

Occurs at any time, may be precipitated by too much food/alcohol/dehydration/starting a diuretic.

Untreated attack lasts ~7 days.

Recovery associated with desquamation of overlying skin.

Followed by asymptomatic intercritical phase; 2nd acute attack within 2y likely.

25% attacks in joint other than toe.


#### —> CHRONIC TOPHACEOUS GOUT

Tophus: smooth, chalky, white deposit with a characteristic feathery appearance (on histology). 

Formed by large aggregates of urate crystals.

There can also be granulomatous inflammation and hyperplastic fibrotic synovium. 

Gouty deposits may be surrounded by fibrous tissue and be rimmed by histiocytes and foreign body giant cells. 

Tophi occur around joints and in the skin. Most commonly they are found in the fingers and the helix/anti-helix of the ears. 

They can also be found in multiple other locations such as the toes, in the olecranon bursa, along the olecranon and around the Achilles tendon. 

Tophi can develop small sinus tracts and secrete material, or ulcerate.

There is chronic joint pain and sometimes superimposed acute gouty attacks.

On Xray: periarticular deposits lead to halo of radio-opacity and clearly defined bone cysts.

Often associated w renal impairment and/or long term use of diuretics.


#### OTHER:

Chronic interval gout: acute attacks superimposed on low grade inflammation and potential joint damage.

Chronic polyarticular gout: rare, except in elderly people on longstanding diuretic treatment, in renal failure, or when allopurinol started too soon after an acute attack.

Hyperuricaemia can also cause urate renal stone formation.

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

—> exclude septic arthritis in any monoarthropathy

—> haemarthrosis

—> CPPD (pseudogout)

—> palindromic RA

#### INVESTIGATIONS

Xray:

- early stages: only soft-tissue swelling
- later: well-defined ‘punched out’ erosions in juxta-articular bone
- no sclerotic reaction; joint spaces preserved until late

Synovial fluid aspiration:

- Joint fluid microscopy - negatively birefringent urate crystals (long, slender, needle-shaped).
- Turbid, yellow colour.
- Decreased viscosity.
- WBC/mm3: 5-50,000
- Neutrophils: ~80%

Serum uric acid: usually raised, although level falls immediately after an acute attack.

Serum urea, creatinine and eGFR monitored for signs of renal impairment.

#### TREATMENT

NSAIDs or coxibs in high doses rapidly reduces pain and swelling.

1st dose should be taken at 1st sign of attack:

- naproxen 750mg immediately, 500mg every 8-12 hours
- diclofenac 75-100mg immediately, 50mg every 6-8 hours
- indometacin 75mg immediately, 50mg every 6-8 hours
- frequency of side effect unacceptably high for some

After 24-48 hours, reduced doses given for a week. 

If CI (e.g. peptic ulcer, heart failure, anticoagulation), colchicine effective but slower to work.

- colchicine 1000 micrograms immediately, 500 micrograms every 6-12 hours (diarrhoea/colicky abdominal pain side effects)

In renal impairment NSAIDs and colchicine problematic so steroids (oral, IM or intra-articular) used.


—> Dietary advice

- reduce alcohol intake, especially beer
- reduce non-diet carbonated drinks
- reduce total calorie and cholesterol intake and avoid foods like offal, some fish and shellfish, and spinach
- avoid prolonged fasts


—> Prophylaxis (treatments to reduce serum uric acid levels) - start if >1 attack in 12m, tophi or renal stones:

- allopurinol
- febuxostat
- pegloticase
- uricosuric agents
- losartan
- anakinra
