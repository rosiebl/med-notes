# RHEUMATOID ARTHIRITIS

RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease characterised by symmetrical, deforming, peripheral polyarthritis.

Autoimmune disease associated with antibodies to to Fc portion of IgG (rheumatoid factor) and to citrullinated cyclic peptide.

Characterised by persistent synovitis, causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis and systemic inflammation.

Heterogenous group of diseases.

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Worldwide distribution.

0.5-1% of the population affected.

F:M 3:1.

Low prevalence in black African and Chinese people.

Incidence falling.

Peak onset 5th-6th decade but can present from early childhood to old age.

### AETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

Multifactorial cause with genetic and environmental factors.

Gender: women pre-menopause affected 3x as often as men - link to sex hormones.

Familial

Genetic: accounts for about 60% of disease susceptibility - strong association with HLA haplotypes e.g. HLA-DR4/DR1.

Smoking: environmental risk factor for seropositive RA


RA is a synovial disease which invades local tissues. Synovitis happens when chemoattractants produced in joint attract inflammatory cells.

Key inflammatory element: overproduction and overexpression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Driven by interaction of macrophages and T and B cells.

TNF-alpha stimulates overproduction of IL-6 and other cytokines. 

Triggering antigen which leads to self-maintained inflammation in RA still unclear.

### PATHOLOGY

In rheumatoid arthritis there is widespread persistent synovitis.

The normal synovium consists of a thin layer, a few cells thick, made up of fibroblast-like synoviocytes and macrophages over loose connective tissue.

In synovitis:

—> synovium thickens

—> proliferates into folds and fronds

—> infiltrated by inflammatory cells including polymorphs, lymphocytes and plasma cells, plus lymphoid follicles are disorganised

—> layer of lining cells becomes thickened and hyperplastic

—> marked vascular proliferation

—> increased permeability of blood vessels & synovial lining layer 

—> joint effusions containing lymphocytes and dying polymorphs

Hyperplastic synovium spreads from the joint margins over the cartilage, forming a pannus. This damages the cartilage underneath both because it blocks the normal route for accessing nutrition and also because of direct damage by cytokines to chondrocytes. The pannus thins the cartilage and exposes underlying bone.

Local cytokine production and joint disuse produce juxta-articular osteoporosis in active synovitis

Fibroblasts also grow along blood vessels between the synovial margins and the epiphyseal bone cavity, damaging the bone. Occurs in 1st 3-6 months after onset, visible on MRI before can see erosions on Xray - justifies use of DMARDs.


#### RHEUMATOID FACTORS AND ANTI-CITRULLINATED PEPTIDE ANTIBODIES

RF: 

- circulating Ab
- Ag is Fc portion of IgG
- normally important for removing immune complexes
- in RA have higher affinity & production is persistent & in the joints
- any Ig class but most tests detect IgM RF
- not diagnostic but useful for prognosis prediction

ACPA:

- usually present with RF in RA
- better predictor of transition to persistent synovitis/early RA

### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
#### SYMPTOMS
Typically affects small joints of hands and feet symmetrically.

Swollen, painful, stiff joints.

Worse in the morning.

Slow onset with progressive worsening of the disease.

Larger joints may be involved.

Less common:

- sudden onset, widespread arthritis
- palindromic RA: recurring mono/polyarthritis of various joints
- persistent monoarthritis e.g. knee, shoulder or hip
- non-articular manifestations
	- systemic illness with extra-articular symptoms but initially few joint problems - more common in men
		- e.g. fatigue, fever, weight loss, pericarditis, pleurisy
	- polymyalgic onset - vague pain in limb girdles
	- recurrent soft tissue problems e.g. carpal tunnel

#### SIGNS

Early - inflammation, no joint damage:

- swollen MCP, PIP, wrist or MTP joints (often symmetrical)
- ?tenosynovitis, ?bursitis

Late - joint damage, deformity:

- ulnar deviation of fingers
- dorsal wrist subluxation
- Boutonniere and swan-neck fingers
- z-deformity of thumbs
- ?ruptured hand extensor tendons
- ?similar foot changes
- ?larger joints
- ?atlanto-axial joint subluxation

### NON-ARTICULAR MANIFESTATIONS

#### Common non-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis:

—> subcutaneous nodules: firm, intradermal nodules, usually over pressure points e.g. elbows, finger joints, Achilles tendon. Resembles synovitis without synovial space. May ulcerate and become infected.

—> tendon sheath swelling

—> tenosynovitis: stiffness, sometimes a trigger finger (flexor tendons in hand)

—> bursitis

—> osteoporosis: more common in poorly controlled RA

#### Less common non-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis:

##### Eyes 

—> scleritis

—> scleromalacia perforans: rare, nodules in the sclera

—> Sjogren’s syndrome: includes Sicca syndrome - dry eyes and mouth

##### Vasculitis 

—> nail fold infarcts of vasculitis

—> widespread cutaneous vasculitis with necrosis of skin e.g. leg ulcers

—> necrotising arteries of mesenteric vessels causing bowel infarction

##### Heart and peripheral vessels 

—> pericarditis: rarely symptomatic

—> endocarditis, myocarditis: rarely symptomatic

—> ankle oedema

—> Raynaud’s syndrome

##### Nervous system 

—> cervical cord compression: from atlantoaxial subluxation

—> peripheral sensory neuropathies: due to vasculitis of vasa nervorum

—> compression neuropathies: carpal or tarsal tunnel syndrome from synovitis

##### Lungs 

—> intrapulmonary nodules: asymptomatic but may capitate, especially with pneumoconiosis (Caplan’s syndrome)

—> pleural effusion and thickening

—> fibrosing alveolitis: inflammation + basal lung fibrosis

—> small airway disease: spectrum from bronchiectasis to obliterative bronchiolitis



##### Kidneys 

—> amyloidosis: causes proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease. Occurs rarely in longstanding RA due to SAP deposition in organs’ ECM

##### Spleen, lymph nodes, blood

—> Felty’s syndrome: splenomegaly and neutropenia in RA. Complications are sepsis and leg ulcers

—> lymphadenopathy

—> anaemia: almost universal, usually normochromic and normocytic

### INVESTIGATIONS

Rheumatoid factor seropositive in ~70%.

Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) highly specific for RA: positive in ~98%.

General bloods:

- often anaemia of chronic disease.
- inflammation causes increased platelets, ESR CRP

Xray:

- soft tissue swelling
- juxta-articular osteopenia
- decreased joint space
- later bony erosions, subluxation or complete carpal destruction

US and MRI more accurate for identifying synovitis and greater sensitivity for bone erosion.

Synovial fluid aspiration:

- Joint effusions containing lymphocytes and dying polymorphs.
- Turbid, yellow colour.
- Decreased viscosity.	
- WBC/mm3: 1-50,000
- Neutrophils: varies

For dx criteria see Oxford Handbook.

### MANAGEMENT

Disease activity measured using DAS28 score (looks at number of joints swollen/tender, ESR and CRP). Aim to reduce to <3.

Early use of **DMARDs** and **biological agents** to improve outcomes.

**Steroids** to rapidly reduce symptoms and inflammation. Useful to treat flares. e.g.: 

- depot methylprednisolone 80-120mg
- intra-articular steroids - rapid but short-term effect
- PO e.g. prednisolone 7.5mg/d - can control difficult symptoms but long term side effects

**NSAIDs**: good symptoms relief but no effect on disease progression.

**Physio** and occupational therapy.

**Surgery** may relieve pain, improve function, prevent deformity.

Quit smoking.

Manage cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors.

Focus on quality of life.

#### DRUG TREATMENT PATHWAY

Pts with newly diagnosed active RA should be put on a combination of DMARDs wihtin 3 months of onset of persistent symptoms, including methotrexate and at least one other, plus short term glucocorticoids.

		Popular DMARDs:
		- methotrexate 
		- sulfasalazine
		- hydroxychloroquine

If this is insufficient to control the disease (i.e. DAS28 is >5.1 on 2 occasions, and have done 2 trials of DMARDs), move on to biologicals, usually in combination with methotrexate.

Options are:

- TNF alpha inhibitors
- B cell depletion
- IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition
- disruption of T cell function

Most popular/initial choice is TNF alpha inhibition e.g. infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumb-pegol and golimumab.
