# OSTEOARTHRITIS

Most common type of arthritis.

Characterised by cartilage loss with accompanying periarticular bone response. Whole joint involved. Significant inflammation of articular and periarticular structures.

Common pathological feature: focal destruction of articular cartilage. 

Multifactorial process - mechanical factors have central role.

_______

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Prevalence increases with age.

Uncommon <50; most over 60 have radiological evidence but only ~25% symptomatic.

Women > men.

________

### AETIOLOGY

Abnormal local mechanical factors which affect loading and wear play a role in most OA.

NOT the inevitable result of trauma and ageing - result of active, sometimes inflammatory but potentially reparative processes.

Predisposing factors:

- obesity
- heredity
- gender - women (post-menopause)
- hypermobility
- osteoporosis reduces risk
- diseases
- trauma - any joint fracture, meniscal/cruciate ligament tears - knee
- congenital joint dysplasia
- joint congruity
- occupation
- sport 

Common pathological feature: focal destruction of articular cartilage. 

Spectrum between atrophic disease with cartilage destruction with no subchondral bone response, to hypertrophic disease with massive new bone formation at the joint margins.

Normal: dynamic balance between cartilage degradation by wear and cartilage production by chondrocytes.

Early OA: balance lost - increased synthesis of ECM but cartilage becomes oedematous. Focal erosion of cartilage. Chondrocytes die. Repair process disordered.

Later: ECM synthesis fails, cartilage surface becomes fibrillated and fissured. Cartilage ulceration exposes underlying bone to stress —> microfractures, cysts. 

Bone attempts repair, produces abnormal sclerotic subchondral bone with eburnation and subchondral cysts, and overgrows at joint margins (osteophytes). Some secondary inflammation.


PATHOGENESIS: many mechanisms have been suggested - see Kumar and Clark.

________

### PRIMARY VS. SECONDARY

Primary: no known cause.

Secondary:
	
- pre-existing joint damage
	- rheumatoid arthritis
	- gout
	- spondyloarthritis
	- septic arthritis
	- paget’s disease
	- avascular necrosis e.g. corticosterpoid therapy
- metabolic disease
	- chondrocalcinosis
	- hereditary haemochromatosis
	- acromegaly
- systemic diseases
	- haemophilia - recurrent haemarthrosis
	- haemoglobinopathies e.g. sickle cell disease 
	- neuropathies

________

### CLINICAL FEATURES

Symptoms:

- joint pain
- short-lived morning joint stiffness
- functional limitation

Signs:

- crepitus
- restricted movement
- bony enlargement
- joint effusion and variable levels of inflammation
- bony instability and muscle wasting

________

### LOCALISED OA


#### NODAL OA

Familial.

Joints of hand.

1 at a time over several years.

DIPs more often than PIPs.

Often starts at menopause/late middle age.

Onset may be painful, e tenderness, swelling, inflammation. Settles to painless bony swellings posterolaterally w stiffness + deformity.

Heberden’s nodes: DIPs
Bouchard’s nodes: PIPs

Coexists w thumb base OA.

Functional impairment slight for most.

NB. Nodal generalised osteoarthritis (NGOA) - NOA associated with OA of knee, hip and spine.


#### HIP OA

7-25% adult Caucasians; significantly less common in black African and Asian populations.

2 subgroups: superior-pole hip OA and medial cartilage loss.

Superior-pole hip OA:
	- most common in men
	- predominantly affects weight-bearing upper surface of femoral head + adjacent acetabulum
	- unilateral at presentation
	- early onset associated w acetabular dysplasia or labral tears

Medial cartilage loss:
	- most common in women
	- associated w hand involvement (NGOA)
	- usually bilateral
	- more rapidly disabling


#### KNEE OA

Prevalence of symptomatic knee OA in over 75s = 40%.

F>M

Strong relationship w obesity. Other risk factors = previous trauma, meniscal/cruciate ligament tears.

Strongly associated w nodal OA of hand in elderly women or in NGOA.

Generally bilateral.

Medial compartment most commonly affected —> varus (bow-legged) deformity.


#### PRIMARY GENERALIZED OA

Rare.

Usually w NOA (NGOA).

Joints affected - knees, first MTP, hip, intervertebral (spondylosis).

Often sudden and spontaneous onset.

F>M; strongly familial.


#### EROSIVE OA

Rare.

DIPs and PIPs inflamed + equally affected.

Marked osteolysis on radiograph.

Destructive phases —> remodelling.


#### CRYSTAL-ASSOCIATED OA

Commonly seen w calcium pyrophosphate deposition in cartilage.

Increase frequency w age (40% in knee Xrays >80y) but usually asymptomatic.

Usually knees, wrists and shoulders.

Chronic arthropathy occurs - pseudo-OA.

Florid inflammatory component, marked osteophyte and cyst formation on Xray.

Associated w pseudo-gout.

Rare, rapidly destructive arthritis in elderly women, poor outlook.

________

### INVESTIGATIONS

Blood tests:

- no specific test
- ESR normal
- high sensitivity CRP may be high
- negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies

Xray (only abnormal in advanced damage):

- Loss of joint space
- Osteophytes
- Subarticular sclerosis
- Subchondral cysts

MRI:

- meniscal tears
- early cartilage injury
- subchondral bone marrow changes - osteochondral lesions

Arthroscopy:

- early fissuring
- surface erosion of cartilage

Aspiration of synovial fluid:

- Clear, straw colour.
- Increased viscosity.
- WBC/mm3: ~<1000
- Neutrophils: ~<50%
- There may be some deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals which may contribute to joint damage.

________

### MGMT

—> SEE NICE GUIDELINE PATHWAY

Aim to treat symptoms/disability, not radiological findings.

Depression + poor quad strength are better indicators of pain than radiological severity.


#### PHYSICAL MEASURES

Weight loss.

Exercises for strength and stability, hydrotherapy (esp for lower limb OA).

Local heat/ice packs/massage/rubefacients/local NSAID gels.

Acupuncture for knee has some evidence (K&C) but NICE guidelines state should not be offered.


#### MEDICATION

No proven agent to halt or reverse OA.

Paracetamol before NSAIDs.

NSAIDs or coxibs intermittently when possible.

Use opioids w caution in elderly pts.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for painful joint effusions (avoid frequent same joint).


#### SURGERY

Knee arthroscopy not helpful but replacement knee arthroplasty important in mgmt.

Hip and knee replacement = in safety. Complication rate ~1%.

For most total hip or knee replacement reduces pain and stiffness, increases function, mobility and independence.

Other things:

- resurfacing hip surgery: popular, ?higher complications in women
- unicompartmental knee replacement: less major, appropriate for some
- realignment osteotomy of knee or hip
- excision arthroplasty of 1st MTP and base of thumb
- fusion of 1st MTP joint
