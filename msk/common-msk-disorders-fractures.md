# COMMON FRACTURES

Soft tissue injury around broken bone - soft tissue often causes more problems than the bone.

### Types of fracture

**Open** fracture: 'compound' fracture, surface wound communicates with fracture.

**Closed** fracture: skin intact.

Fracture patterns:

- transverse
- oblique
- spiral
- multifragmentary
- avulsion - bony fragment pulled off by tendon or ligament
- compression/crush - crumpled cancellous bone e.g. vertebral bodies in osteoporosis
- greenstick - in children, cortex breaks on one side and buckles on the other
- pathological - e.g. in malignancy, and technically in osteoporosis

**Dislocation**: complete loss of congruity between articulating surfaces of a joint. Implies disruption to capsule and soft tissues of joint.

**Subluxation**: partial loss of contact between two joint surfaces.

### Management

	--> Resuscitation
	--> Reduction
	--> Restriction
	--> Rehabilitation


### Upper limb

Radius and ulnar shaft:

- Monteggia: ulnar shaft # with radial head dislocation
- Galleazzi: radial shaft # with distal radioulnar joint dislocation

Distal radius:

- Colles': extra-articular # of distal radius with dorsal displacement and radial shift of distal fragment
	- complications:
		- malunion
		- median nerve problems
		- 'frozen shoulder' - usually adhesive capsulitis
		- tendon rupture
		- Sudek's atrophy
		- carpal tunnel
- Smith's: 'reverse Colles' - extra-articular # of distal radius, distal radial fragment displaced anteriorly, distal articular radius surface tilted 11 degrees volar
- Barton's: fracture dislocation where distal radial # is oblique and extends into the wrist joint

Scaphoid:

- may be normal on radiograph for 10 days
- risk of AVN in proximal scaphoid as blood supply enters distally

Supracondylar # humerus: 

- common in children
- risk of injury to brachial artery 
- risk or compartment syndrome

Dislocated shoulder: can reduce under sedation in casualty dept. Risk of recurrent instability. Remember possibility of posterior dislocation.




### Lower limb

Neck of femur

- intracapsular vs extracapsular
- intracapsular:
	- older patients: hemiarthroplasty
	- younger patients: ORIF
- exatracapsular: ORIF with dynamic hip screw

Femoral and tibial #:

- risk of high blood loss
- risk of compartment syndrome
- femur: traction splint
- tibia: padded board/long leg splint
- intramedullary nail best treatment
- can do ex-fix or plate/screws
