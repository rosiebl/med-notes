# OSTEOPOROSIS

Osteoporosis is a complex skeletal disease characterised by low bone density and micro-architectural defects in bone tissue, resulting in increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture.

Primary: age-related.

Secondary: related to another conditon or drugs.

Likely fractures:

- where trabecular bone affected, vertebral crush fractures common
- where cortical bone affected, long bone fractures more common e.g. NOF


## EPIDEMIOLOGY

Over 50yo:

- men 6%
- women 18%

Women lose trabeculae with age.

In men there is reduced bone formation but numbers of trabeculae are stable and lifetime risk of fracture is less.

### RISK FACTORS

Age-independent risk factors for primary osteoporosis:

- parental hx
- alcohol >4 units daily
- rheumatoid arthritis
- BMI <22
- prolonged immobility
- untreated menopause

Other risk factors, including for secondary OA:

- Steroid use of >5mg/d prednisolone
- Hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalciuria
- Alcohol and tobacco use
- Thin (BMI <22)
- Testosterone decreased 
- Early menopause
- Renal or liver failure
- Erosive/inflammatory bone disease e.g. myeloma, RA
- Dietary calcium decreased, e.g. malabsorption, T1DM

## INVESTIGATIONS

Xray

- low sensitivity/specificity
- often with hindsight after fracture

Bone mineral density

- DEXA scan
- hip scan better than lumbar spine
- T score = number of standard deviations the bone mineral density is from a healthy young adult
- increase in 1 = ~2.6x increase in hip fracture risk

		T-score >0 = BMD better than reference 

		0 to -1 = BMD in top 84%, no evidence of osteoporosis

		-1 to -2.5 = osteopenia, risk of later osteoporotic fracture, offer lifestyle advice

		-2.5 or worse = osteoporosis, offer lifestyle advice and treatment.

Bloods: calcium, phosphate and alk phos all normal.

Biopsy unreliable and unnecessary.

## MANAGEMENT

### LIFESTYLE

Quit **smoking**, reduce **alcohol**.

**Weight-bearing exercises** may increase bone density.

**Balance exercises** e.g. tai chi reduce risk of falls.

Calcium and vitamin D rich **diet**, including supplements if necessary.

Home-based **fall prevention** programme with visual assessment and home visit.  

### PHARMACOLOGICAL MEASURES

##### Bisphopshonates

1st line: alendronate 

- 10mg/d or 70mg/wk
- not if eGFR <35
- swallow pills with plenty of water while remaining upright for >30 mins, then wait 30 mins before eating or taking other drugs

Side effects:

- photosensitivity
- GI upset
- oesophageal ulcers - stop if dysphagia or abdo pain
- jaw osteonecrosis (rarely)

If intolerant, use etidronate or risedronate.

Also used for prevention in long-term steroid use.


##### Calcium and Vitamin D

Rarely used prophylactically alone as questionable efficacy + possible small CV risk.

Offer if evidence of deficiency.

##### Strontium ranelate

Helps reduce fracture rates.

Alternative where bisphosphonate intolerance.

Reduces reabsorption, may increase bone formation.

##### Hormone replacement therapy

Can prevent (not treat) osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.

Relative risk of breast cancer 1.4 if used >10y + increased CV risk.

##### Raloxifene

Selective oestrogen receptor modulator.

Similar action to HRT but reduced breast cancer risk.

##### Teriparatide

Recombinant PTH.

Useful in those suffering further fractures despite treatment with other agents.

Potential increased risk of renal malignancy.

##### Calcitonin

May reduce pain after vertebral fracture.

##### Testosterone

May help in hypogonadal men by promoting trabecular connectivity.

##### Denosumab

Monoclonal Ab to RANK ligand.

Given SC twice a year.

Decreases reabsorption.

##### PATHWAY

**Not glucocorticoid induced in postmenopausal women with fragility fracture or DXA T-score <-2.5:**

1. bisphosphonates 
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation 
2. raloxifene or denosumab
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation 
  
Bisphosphonates and raloxifene not tolerated/contraindicated:

1. teriparatide
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation
2. HRT or denusomab
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation

**Not glucocorticoid-induced in men with fragility fracture or DXA T-score <-2.5:**

1. bisphosphonates 
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation 
	- zoledronic acid

Fragility fracture or DXA T-score <-2.5 and low testosterone:

1. testosterone added to oral bisphosphonates 
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation 


Bisphosphonates and raloxifene not tolerated/contraindicated:

1. teriparatide or denusomab
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation

**Glucocorticoid induced:**

1. bisphosphonates 
	- with calcium and Vitamin D supplementation
