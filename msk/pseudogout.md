# PSEUDOGOUT

### CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE DEPOSITION (CPPD)

Umbrella term to describe different patterns of disease:

Acute CPPD crystal arthritis: previously known as pseudogout. Acute monoarthropathy typically of larger joint in older pts. Usually spontaneous and self-limiting but can be provoked by illness/surgery/trauma.

Chronic CPPS: inflammatory RA-like symmetrical polyarthritis and synovitis.

Osteoarthritis with CPPD: chronic polyarticular osteoarthritis with superimposed acute CPPD attacks.

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

—> PYROPHOSPHATE ARTHROPATHY

Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) deposits in hyaline and fibrocartilage —> radiological appearance of chondrocalcinosis.

Crystals shed into joint which precipitates acute synovitis.

Resembles gout, except more common in elderly women and usually affects knee or wrist.

Attacks often v painful.

In young people associated w haemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, Wilson’s disease or alkaptonuria.

### RISK FACTORS

Old age

Hyperparathyroidism

Haemochromatosis

Hypophosphataemia

### DIAGNOSIS

Synovial fluid aspiration:

- Rhomboidal, weakly positively birefringent crystals in synovial fluid (cf negatively birefringent in gout)
- purulent joint fluid

Must exclude septic arthritis - send fluid for culture.

Xray: chondrocalcinosis.

Attacks may be associated with fever and raised wbc count.

### TREATMENT

Acute attacks:
	- cool packs
	- rest
	- aspiration: reduces pain dramatically
	- intra-articular steroids (if infection excluded)

NSAIDs +/- colchicine 0.5-1.0mg.24h (used with caution) may help prevent acute attacks.

Methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine have role in chronic CPPD.
