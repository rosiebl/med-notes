# PAEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS

Difficulties: normal variants vs abnormality, handicap/prognosis for future life, child abuse/non-accidental injury.

Visibility of growth plate on radiograph defines immature vs mature skeleton.

Important secondary ossification centres can age the child and work out what is a fracture and what is a growth centre. e.g. elbow is made of cartilage in youth and ossifies as child develops, so looking at radiograph can show 'age' of child.

Chronological vs bone age.

Bone age based on radiological atlases of variants.

### PAEDIATRIC HIP/LIMPING CHILD

Developmental dysplasia of the hip

Legg-Calves-Perthes' disease - avascular necrosis to the developing hip, age 4-9.

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (or slipped upper femoral epiphysis SUFE) - shear fracture through the growth plate.

Infection

Transient synovitis

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis/Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

See slides for fuller ddx.


Foot: congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV).
