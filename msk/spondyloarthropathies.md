# SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES

		Ankylosing spondylitis
		Enteric arthropathy
		Psoriatic arthritis
		Reactive arthritis

Shared features of the spondyloarthropathies:
 
- Seronegativity - rheumatoid factor negative
- HLA B27 association
- Axial arthritis
	- pathology in spine and sacroiliac joints
- Asymmetrical large-joint oligoarthritis OR monoarthritis
- Enthesitis
	- inflammation of tendon insertion
	- plantr fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, costochondritis
- Dactylitis
	- inflammation of a whole digit
	- soft tissue oedema, tenosynovial and joint inflammation
- Extra-articular manifestations
	- e.g. iritis, psoriaform rashes, oral ulcers, aortic valve incompetence, IBD 
	

## ENTERIC ARTHROPATHY

Associations:

- inflammatory bowel disease
- GI bypass
- coeliac disease
- Whipple's disease

Arthropathy often improves with treatment of bowel symptoms.

Beware NSAIDs.

Use DMARDs for resistant cases.


## PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS

10-40% people with psoriasis.

Can present before skin changes.

Patterns:

- symmetrical polyarthritis (like RA)
- DIP joints
- asymmetrical oligoarthritis
- spinal (like AS)
- psoriatic arthritis mutilans 
	- rare
	- ~3%
	- severe deformity
	
Radiology:

- erosive changes
- 'pencil in cup' deformity in severe cases


Associated with nail changes in 80%, synovitis, acneiform rashes, palmo-plantar pustulosis.

Management:

- NSAIDs
- sulfasalazine
- methotrexate
- ciclosporin
- anti-TNF agents
	

## REACTIVE ARTHRITIS

Reactive arthritis: inflammatory arthritis that occurs after exposure to certiain GI and GU infections.

Not the same as septic arthritis as this is a sterile arthritis.

Typically affects the lower limb.

Usually ~1-4 weeks after urethritis (Chalmydia or Uroplasma) or dysentry (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia).

Chronic or relapsing.

Can be seen with:

- iritis
- keratoderma blenorrhagica: brown raised plaques on soles and palms
- circinate balanitis: painless penile ulceration secondary to Chlamydia
- mouth ulcers
- enthesitis

Classic triad: urethritis, arthritis, conjunctivitis. Often described, rarely seen.

### INVESTIGATIONS

ESR and CRP increased.

Culture stool if diarrhoea.

Infectious serology.

Sexual health review.

Xray: may show enthsitis with periosteal reaction.

### MANAGEMENT

No specific cure.

NSAIDs/local steroid injections.

If symptoms >6 months, consider sulfasalazine/methotrexate.

NB. Treating original infection may make little difference to the arthritis (cf. enteric arthopathy).
