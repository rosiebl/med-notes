# POLYMYOSITIS AND DERMATOMYOSITIS

Rare.

Characterised by insidious onset of pregressive symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and autoimmune-mediated striated muscle inflamamtion associated with myalgia Â± arthralgia.

Muscle weakness may cause:

- dysphagia
- dysphonia i.e. poor phonation, not dysphagia
- respiratory weakness


Myositis (esp in dermatomyositis) may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Commonly from lung, pancreatic, ovarin or bowel malignancy.

Dermatomyositis features myositis plus skin signs:

- macular rash 
	- shawl sign +ve if over shoulders and back
- lilac-purple (heliotrope) rash on eyelids, often with oedema
- nailfold erythema - dilated capillary loops
- Gottron's papules - roughened red papules over the knuckles, also on elbows and knees
- subcutaneous calcifications

NB. Gottron's papules are pathognomonic if present with increased CK and muscle weakness.

Extra-muscular signs:

- fever
- arthralgia
- Raynaud's 
- interstitial lung fibrosis
- myocardial involvement - myocarditis, arrhythmias


INVESTIGATIONS

Plasma muscle enzymes increased (ALT, AST, LDH, CK and aldolase).
