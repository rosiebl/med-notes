# Trauma & Orthopaedics workbook

## Management of major injuries

#### 1. What is the aim of ATLS?

Resuscitate and stabilise the patient.

Identify life-threatening conditions in order or risk and initiate supportive treatment.

Organise definitive treatments or organise transfer for definitive treatments.

#### 2. What is triage and where does it take place?

Triage is the sorting of patients according to their need for treatment and the resources available. It aims to identify the patients most likely to deteriorate clinically by evaluating vital signs, pre-hospital clinical course, mechanism of injury, age and past medical history. This is done using the ABCDE system:

Airway maintenance (with cervical spine protection)
Breathing and ventilation
Circulation (with haemorrhage control)
Disability - neurological status
Exposure/environmental control

It begins at the scene of the trauma and continues at the hospital.

#### 3. Which components make up the primary survey?

Airway maintenance and cervical spine protection:

- look:
	- obvious distress, e.g. gasping for air, accessory muscle use
	- cyanosis
	- swelling
	- foreign bodies in airway
	- facial, mandibular or laryngeal fractures
- feel for breaths
- listen:
	- stridor
	- snoring
	- gurgling
	- absence of breath sounds
- management:
	- establish a clear airway but protect the cervical spine at all times
	if GCS <8 or pt can't maintain airwya integrity, establish a definitive airway

Breathing and ventilation

- look:
	- obvious distress, e.g. gasping for air, accessory muscle use
	- face: cyanosis, pursed lips, nasal flaring
	- neck: accessory muscle use, tracheal deviation
	- body: accessory muscle use, symmetrical chest expansion
- feel:
	- tracheal deviation
	- symmetrical chest expansion
	- percussion of the chest
	- sacral oedema
- listen: breath sounds
- measure:
	- respiratory rate
	- O2 saturation
- management:
	- tension pneumothorax - needle thoracostomy then drainage
	- flail chest - ventilation
	- haemothorax - intercostal drain insertion
	- pneumothorax - may need intercostal drain insertion

Circulation with haemorrhage control

- look:
	- level of consciousness
	- face: cyanosis, sweating, pallor
	- neck: JVP
	- body: oedema, scars
- feel:
	- carotid pulse volume and character
	- radial pulse
	- heaves and thrills
	- apex beat
	- central capillary refill
- listen: heart sounds
- measure:
	- heart rate
	- blood pressure
	- temperature
	- urine output
	- capillary refill
- management:
	- two wide-bore cannulae
	- cross-match group and save
	- could give O- blood
	- fluid challenge

Disability/neurological status

- measure:
	- level of consciousness using GCS
	- pupil size/symmetry/reaction
	- lateralising signs
	- level of spinal cord injury
	- remembered oxygenation, ventilation, perfusion, substances and blood glucose all affect consciousness

Exposure

- undress patient but prevent hypothermia

#### 4. Which X-rays make up the ‘trauma series’?

There are 3 standard films which screen for injuries:

1. cervical spine (lateral)
2. chest
3. pelvis

Additionally do any other views relevant to the patient's injuries.

#### 5. What are the components of the secondary survey in relation to Orthopaedics?

Full examination and history while also reassessing things covered by the primary survey.

History includes:

- Allergies
- Medication currently used
- Past illnessess and pregnancy
- Last meal
- Events/environment related to injury

Physical examination repeats some things form the primary survey, aiming to identify serious injuries. Neurological status is reviewed. 


## Principles of fracture management

Treat the pt as a whole: ensure they are stable, check for any other subtle fractures or injuries, and then treat the fracture.

To treat a fracture:

	REDUCE
	STABILISE
	REHABILITATE

### Reduction

Fractures do not need to be reduced if they're undisplaced or minimally displaced, if it's unlikely to succeed (e.g. vertebral fractures) or when displacement does not significantly affect function (e.g. in clavicle fractures). 

Aim: normal alignment good apposition of the bone fragments.  

a)    Closed Reduction is used for minimally displaced fractures, fractures in children and for fractures that are not unstable after reduction and can be held in a splint or cast.  The manoeuvre is to pull the distal part of the limb in the line of the bone to disimpact the fracture, then repositioning the fracture and adjusting the alignment.

 

b)   Open Reduction of the fracture under direct vision means opening the skin with an incision in the operating theatre.  This is required if the closed reduction fails or when open reduction is the first step to internal fixation with metalwork (also known as open reduction internal fixation, ORIF).
