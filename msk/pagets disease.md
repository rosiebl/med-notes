# PAGET'S DISEASE

*Osteitis deformans*

Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterised by increased bone resorption, bone formation and remodelling, leading to bone enlargement, deformity and weakness.

May lead to:

- osseous deformities
- structural weakness
- altered joint biomechanics
- bone fractures
- cranial and spinal nerve compressions

Associated with increased numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, hence resultant increased bone turnover.

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

Rare in under-40s.

Incidence rises with age: 3% in over 55yo.

Commoner in temperate climates and in Anglo-Saxons.

### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Asymptomatic in ~70%.

Deep, boring pain.

Bony deformity and enlargement.

Typically affects pelvis, lumbar spine, skull, femur and tibia.

Complications:

- pathological fractures
- osteoarthritis
- increased calcium
- high output CCF if >40% skeleton involved
- osteosarcoma
	- <1% of affected for >10y
	- suspect if sudden onset/worsening of bony pain
- neurological symptoms from skull remodelling and nerve compression:
	- hearing loss
	- chronic facial pain
	- hydrocephalus
	- spinal stenosis

### INVESTIGATIONS

Xray:

- affinity for axial skeleton, long bones, skull
- localised bone enlargement
- patchy cortical thickening
- sclerosis
- osteolysis
- deformity e.g. osteoporosis circumscripta of skull
- classic bowed sabre tibia

Bone scan may reveal 'hot spots'.

Blood chemistry:

- calcium normal
- phosphate normal
- alk phos markedly raised

See notes for metabolic bone disease biochemistry comparison.

Dx usually incidental. Bone biopsy is only confirmatory diagnostic test but rarely indicate.

### MANAGEMENT

NSAIDs and other analgesics for pain and other inflammatory symptoms.

Non-drug therapy: physiotherapy, orthoses, walking aids, hearing aids, corrective lenses.

If fails, can try alendronate to reduce pain and/or deformity. Aim to retard excessive osteoclastic activity.

- more effective than etidronate or calcitonin
- as effective as IV pamidronate
