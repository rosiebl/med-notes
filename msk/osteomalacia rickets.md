#OSTEOMALACIA AND RICKETS

Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterised by incomplete mineralisation of the underlying mature organic bone matrix (osteoid) following growth plate closure in adults.

Rickets is a metabolic bone disease characterised by defective mineralisation of the epiphyseal growth plate cartilage in children, resulting in skeletal deformities and growth retardation.

--> Different manifestations of the same underlying pathological process.

___

### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

#### RICKETS

Develops in early childhood.

- growth retardation
- hypotonia - 'floppy baby syndrome'
- apathy in infants

Once walking:

- knock-kneed
- bow-legged
- deformities of the metaphyseal-epiphyseal junction e.g. rachitic rosary

Features of calcium deficiency often mild.

Children with rickets are ill.

#### OSTEOMALACIA

- bone pain
- tenderness
- pathological fractures, esp. NOF
- proximal myopathy - waddling gait
	- due to phosphate and vitamin D deficiency per se

___

### CAUSES

##### Vitamin D deficiency

Due to malabsorption, poor diet or lack of sunlight.

##### Renal osteodystrophy

Renal failure leads to 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol deficiency.

##### Drug-induced

Aniconvulsants may induce liver enzymes, leading to increased breakdown of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D.

##### Vitamin D resistance

Mainly inherited conditions.

Responds to high doses of vitamin D.

##### Liver disease

Due to:

- reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D to 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol
- malabsorption of vitamin D

e.g. in cirrhosis

##### Tumour-induced osteomalacia 

Oncogenic hypophosphataemia.

Mediated by raised tumour production of phosphatonin fibroblast growth factor 23.

Causes hyperphosphaturia.

Decreased serum phosphate often causes myalgia and weakness.

___

### INVESTIGATIONS

Plasma:

- calcium low (mildly)
- phosphate low
- alk phos high
- PTH high
- 25(OH)-vitamin D low (except in resistance)
- in renal failure 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol low

Biopsy: bone shows incomplete mineralisation. Muscle is normal (done in proximal myopathy).

Xray in osteomalacia:

- loss of cortical bone
- apparent partial fractures w/o displacement, esp in Looser's zones:
	- lateral border scapula
	- inf NOF
	- medial femoral shaft
	
Xray in osteomalacia: cupped, ragged metaphyseal surfaces.

____

### TREATMENT

**Dietary insufficiency**: vitamin D 

- e.g. Calcium D3 Forte tablet 12h/PO.

**Malabsorption** or **hepatic disease**: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or parenteral calcitriol

- vitamin D2 up to 40,000U daily (=4mg)
- parenterol calcitriol e.g. 7.5mg monthly

**Renal disease** or **vitamin D resistance**: give alfacalcidol or calcitriol and adjust dose according to plasma calcium.

- alfacalcidol (1a-hydroxy-vitamin D3) 250mg-1mcg daily
- calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) 250ng-1mcg daily
- can cause dangerously hypercalcaemia

Monitor plasma calcium, initially weekly, and if nausea/vomiting.

___

### Vitamin D-resistant rickets

2 forms.

Type 1: low renal 1a-hydroxylase activity.

Type 2: end-organ resistance to 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 - due to a point mutation in the receptor.

Treatment: large doses calcitriol.

___

### X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets

Dominantly inherited.

Due to defect in renal phosphate handling (due to mutations in the PEX or PHEX genes which encode an endopeptidase).

Low phosphate, high alk phos, phosphaturia.

Treatment: high doses oral phosphate and calcitriol.
