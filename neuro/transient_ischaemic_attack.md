# TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK

A transient ischaemic attack is a sudden onset of focal CNS phenomena due to temporary occlusion of part of the cerebral circulation, usually by emboli, lasting <24h (often much shorter).

Incidence: 0.4/1000/y.

15% of 1st strokes are preceded by TIAs; also harbringers of MI, so good mgmt crucial.

### CAUSES

**Atherothromboembolism** from the carotid: chief cause.

**Cardioembolism**: mural thrombus post-MI or in AF, valve disease, prosthetic valve.

**Hyperviscosity**, e.g.:

- polycythaemia
- sickle cell anaemia
- very high WCC: leukostasis; may need urgent chemotherapy
- myeloma

Vasculitis is a rare cause, perhaps shouldn't be classified as a TIA.

See also all the causes of stroke (see stroke notes).

### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

Attacks are single or many. 

Signs may be the same or different for each TIA.

Features of TIA should always mimic those of stroke in the same arterial territory.

Global events, e.g. syncope, dizziness, not typical of TIA.

Multple highly stereotypes attacks suggest critical intracranial stenosis - commonly superior division of MCA.

Amaurosis fugax:

- emboli can pass to retinal artery
- progressive loss of vision in one eye like curtain descending

Limb-shaking TIA may be mistaken for focal motor seizure.

### SIGNS OF CAUSES

Carotid bruit:

- absence doesn't rule out carotid source
- tight stenoses often have no bruit

Hypertension.

Cardiac signs:

- heart murmur from valve disease
- atrial fibrillation

Fundoscopy during TIA may show retinal artery emboli.

### DDX

- hypoglycaemia

- migraine aura: symptoms spread and intesnfiy over minutes, often with visual scintillations

- focal epilepsy: symptoms spread over seconds and often include twitching + jerking

- hyperventilation

- retinal bleeds

Rare mimics of TIA:

- malignant hypertension

- MS: paroxysmal dysarthria

- intracranial tumours

- peripheral neuropathy

- phaeochromocytoma

- somatization

### INVESTIGATIONS

Aim to find cause + define vascular risk.

- FBC
- ESR
- U&E
- glucose
- lipids

ECG

Imaging:

- CXR
- carotid Doppler Â± angiography
- CT or diffusion-weighted MRI - bilateral existing infarcts suggests cardioembolism
- echocardiogram - rarely shows cardiac cause if no suggestive signs


#### RISK ASSESSMENT

ABCD2 score is used to predict risk of stroke, to aid decisions over who should get a prompt or emergency referral after TIA.

ABCD2 score of >6 strongly predicts stroke: 8.1% in 2 days, 35.5% in next week.

Score >4 should be assessed by specialist within 24h.

All pts with suspected TIA should be seen within 7 days.

Feature | Score
-- | --
Age >60y | 1
Blood pressure >140/90 | 1
Clinical features | 
--> unilateral weakness | 2
--> speech disturbance w/o weakness | 1
Duration of symptoms |
--> symptoms lasting >1h | 2
--> symptoms lasting 10-59 mins | 1
Diabetes | 1

### MGMT

Time to intervnetion crucial: risk of stroke in 1st 90 days after TIA is 2% in those treated within 72h, c.f. 10% in those treated by 3 weeks.

- control cardiovascular risk factors
- antiplatelet drugs
- warfarin
- carotid endarterectomy

#### CONTROL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS

Cautiously reduce BP: aim for <140/85.

Try to control:

- hyperlipidaemia
- diabetes mellitus
- smoking

#### ANTIPLATELET DRUGS

**Clopidogrel** 75mg/d: prevents further strokes + MIs.

**Aspirin** 300mg/d, down to 75mg/d after 2 weeks. also helps, though less than clopidogrel.

When using aspirin, add **dipyridamole** MR 200mg/12h.

#### WARFARIN

Indications: cardiac emboli e.g. AF, mitral stenosis, recent big septal MI.

#### CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY

Do if:

- over 70% stenosis at origin of internal carotid artery
- operative risk good

Surgery within 2 weeks of first presentation.

Intra-operative transcranial Doppler can monitor middle cerebral artery flow.

Alternative: endovascular carotid artery stenting if not suitable for surgery but ?safety + long term benefit.


#### DRIVING

Avoid for 1 month. 

Only inform DVLA if multiple attacks in short period or residual deficit.

### PROGNOSIS

Combined risk stroke + MI ~9%/yr.

Carotid stenosis >70% risk of stroke 12% in 1st yr and up to 10% subsequently.

More frequent TIAs increase risk.

Mortality 3x TIA-free matched population.
