# MONONEUROPATHIES

**Mononeuropathies** are lesions of individual peripheral or cranial nerves.

Causes are usually local, e.g. trauma or entrapment (mass), except for carpal tunnel syndrome (see notes).

**Mononeuritis multiplex**: 2 or more peripheral nerves are affected. Causes tend to be systemic (WARDS PLC):

- Wegener's
- AIDS/amyloid
- rheumatoid
- diabetes mellitus
- sarcoidosis
- PAN
- leprosy
- carcinomatosis

Can use electromyography to help define the anatomic site of a lesion.


Nerve | Nerve root | Signs | Cause
-- | -- | -- | --
**Median nerve** | C6-T1 | At the wrist: weakness of abductor pollicis brevis + sensory loss over radial 3.5 fingers and palm | lacerations, carpal tunnel syndrome
  |   | Anterior interosseous nerve lesions: weakness of flexion of the distal phalanx of the thumb + index finger | trauma
  |  | Proximal lesions: combined defects | compression at elbow
**Ulnar nerve** | C7-T1 | weakness/wasting of medial wrist flexors, interossei + medial 2 lumbricals, hypothenar eminence wasting, sensory loss over medial 1.5 fingers + ulnar side of hand --> can't cross fingers for good luck, claw hand, weak little finger abduction, weak flexion of 4th and 5th DIP joints | vulnerable to elbow trauma
**Radial nerve** | C5-T1 | test wrist and finger drop with elbow flexed + arm pronated, involves brachioradialis, extensors, supinator, triceps  | compression against the humerus
**Brachial plexus** | pain/parasthesiae + weakness in affected arm in variable distribution | trauma, radiotherapy, prolonged wearing of heacy rucksack, cervical rib, neuralgic amyotrophy, thoracic outlet compression
**Phrenic nerve** | C3-C5 | orthopnoea with raised hemidiaphragm on CXR | lung cancer, myeloma, thymoma, cervical spondylosis/trauma, thoracic surgery, C3-5 zoster, HIV, Lyme disease, TB, paraneoplastic syndromes, muscular dystrophy, big left atrium, phrenic nucleus lesion e.g. MS
**Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh** | L2-L3 | *meralgia paraesthetica*: anterolateral burning thigh pain from --> | entrapment under the inguinal ligament
**Sciatic nerve** | L4-S3 | affects hamstrings and all muscles below the knee - foot drop + loss of sensation below knee laterally
**Common peroneal nerve** | L4-S1 | foot drop, weak ankle dorsiflexion/eversion, sensory loss over dorsum of foot | from sciatic nerve jut above knee, often damaged as it winds around the fibular head - trauma, sitting cross-legged
**Tibial nerve** | L4-S3 | can't plantarflex (can't stand on tiptoe), invert the foot or flex the toes + sensory loss over sole | originates from sciatic nerve above knee
