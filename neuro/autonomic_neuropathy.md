# AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY

**Autonomic neuropathy** is a form of polyneuropathy. Sympathetic and parasympathetic neuropathies may be isolated or part of a generalised sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.

### CAUSES

- diabetes mellitus
- amyloidosis
- Guillan-Barre syndrome
- Sjogren's syndrome
- HIV
- leprosy
- SLE
- toxic
- genetic e.g. porphyria
- paraneoplastic e.g.
	- paraneoplastic encephalomyeloneuropathies
	- Lambert-Easton myasthenic syndrome

### SIGNS & SYMPTOMS

- postural hypotension (faints on standing, eating or hot bath) *s*

- erectile dysfunction *p*

- ejaculatory failure *s* ("point and shoot")

- decreased sweating *s*

- constipation 

- nocturnal diarrhoea

- urine retention *p*

- Horner's *s*

- Holmes-Adie pupil *p*

### AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS

Postural BP drop of >20/10mmHg is abnormal.

ECG: variation of <10bpm with respiration is abnormal.

Cystometry: bladder pressure studies.

Pupils: 

- instil 0.1% **epinephrine**: dilates if post-ganglionic sympathetic denervation, not if normal
- 2.5% **cocaine**: dilates if normal: not if sympathetic denervation
- 2.5% **methacholine**: constrits if parasympathetic lesion (rarely used)

Paraneoplastic Abs:

- anti-Hu
- anti-Yo
- anti-Ri
- antiamphiphysin
- anti-CV2
- anti-Ma2

Other Ab: antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor Ab presence shows cause may be autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy


### MGMT

Treat the cause.

?symptomatic relief

### PRIMARY AUTONOMIC FAILURE

Occurs alone (autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy), as part as multisystem atrophy or with Parkinson's disease.

Typically in a middle-aged/elderly man.

Onset: insidious.

Symptoms as above.
