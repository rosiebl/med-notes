# LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME

LEMS can be **paraneoplastic** (from small-cell lung cancer) or **autoimmune**.

Differentiating features from true myasthenia gravis:

- **gait difficulty before eye signs**

- **autonomic involvement** e.g. dry mouth, constipation, impotence

- **hyporeflexia** + **weakness**, which improve after exercise

- less response to edrophonium (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor)

- Ab to the pre-synaptic membrane's voltage-gated calcium channels

- electrical post-tetanic potentiation with >60% increase in post-exercise 
facilitation of abductor digiti quinti

**Management**:

- **3,4-diaminopyridine**, or
- **IV immunoglobulin**

Do regular CXR/high-resolution CT as symptoms may precede cancer by >4y.
