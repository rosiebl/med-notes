### WOMEN WITH EPILEPSY

Women of child-bearing age should take folic acid 5mg/day.

Avoid valproate in particular as teratogenic (use lamotrigine instead).

Pre-conception counselling vital as 5% risk of fetal abnormality.

Breastfeeding: most anti-epileptics apart from carbamazepine and valproate present in breast milk. Lamotrigine thought to not be harmful to infants.

Some anti-epileptics affect dosage of the oral contraceptive pill (enzyme-inducing drugs e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin and barbituites).

### STOPPING ANTICONVULSANTS

Most pts seizure-free within a few years of starting drugs - >50% remain so when drugs withdrawn.

May try withdrawal if pt meets these criteria:

- normal CNS exam

- normal IQ

- normal EEG prior to withdrawal

- seizure free for >2y

- no juvenile myoclonic epilepsy

However, resuming medication after withdrawal may not resume pt to status quo and not all seizures could be controlled.
