# MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an **inflammatory demyelinating** disease characterised by the presence of **episodic neurological dysfunction** in at least **2 areas of the CNS** (brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves) **separated in time and space**.

Symptoms are **relapsing and remitting**.

Prevalence: more common in temperate area, rarer in Africa and Asia.

Lifetime UK risk: 1/1000.

Adult migrants take risk with them; children acquire risk where they settle.

Mean age of onset: 30y.

F:M >3:1.

### CAUSE

Discrete plaques of demylelination occur at multiple CNS sites.

From T-cell mediated immune response (trigger unknown).

Demyelination **heals poorly** - causes **relapsing + remitting symptoms**.

**Prolonged demyelination** causes axonal loss + clinically **progressvie symptoms**.

NB. early exposure to vitamin D is important - status relates  to prevention, + fewer symptoms + fewer new lesions on MRI in established MS.

### PRESENTATION

Presentation is usually monosymptomatic:

- unilateral optic neuritis: pain on eye movement + rapid loss of central vision

- numbness or tingling in the limbs

- leg weakness

- brainstem/cerebellar symptoms e.g. diplopia, ataxia

Symptoms may worsen with heat, e.g. hot bath, or exercise.

Rarely polysymptomatic.

#### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

Sensory: 

- dysaesthesia

- pins + needles

- loss of vibration sense

- trigeminal neuralgia

Motor:

- spastic weakness

- myelitis

Sexual/GU:

- erectile dysfunction

- anorgasmia

- urine retention

- incontinence

GI:

- swallowing disorders

- constipation

Eye:

- diplopia

- hemianopia

- optic neuritis

- visual phenomena, e.g. on exercise

- bilateral intranuclear ophthalmoplegia

- pupil defects
	
Cerebellum:

- trunk + limb ataxia

- intention tremor

- scanning (i.e. monotonous) speech

- falls

Cognitive/visuospatial decline:

- major cause of unemployment, accidents/isolation

- amnesia

- mood increase or decrease (avoid ECT)

- loss of executive functioning

N.B. beware of symptoms which are suggestive of a non-MS recurrent demyelinating disease e.g. sarcoidosis or vasculitis: raised temp, malaise, N+V, positional vertigo, seizures, aphasia, meningism, bilateral optic neuritis, CSF leucocytosis/riased protein.

#### PROGRESSION

Early on, relapses may be followed by remission + complete recovery.

With time, remissions incomplete, so disability accumulates.

May also have steady progression of disability from outset OR no progressive disablement at all.

#### POOR PROGNOSTIC SIGNS

- older men

- motor signs at outset

- many relapses early on

- many MRI lesions

- axonal loss

### Dx

Clinical dx: no test pathognomonic. Can use McDonald criteria.

Needs **lesions disseminated in time + space**, unattributable to other cause: need more evidence after a 1st episode.

Look for past episodes in the hx.

**MRI**:

- MRI sensitive but not specific for plaque detection.

- ~90% presenting with MS-like 1st episode + consistent MRI lesions --> develop MS.

- MRI also rules out DDx e.g. cord compression

**CSF**:

- oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, not present in serum

- suggest CNS inflammation

**Evoked potentials**:

- delayed visual, auditory + somatosensory evoked potentials


**MOG + MBP Abs** in those with single MS-like clinical lesion can predict time to conversion to definite MS.

**NMO-IgG Abs** highly specific for Devic's syndrome (MS variant) 

### MGMT

Encourage happy stress-free life - can reduce development of new lesions.

Minimise disability.

If poor diet/low sun exposure, give vitamin D to serum levels >50nmol/L.

- steroids - **methylprednisolone** to **shorten acute relapses** (doesn't alter prognosis)

- interferons - **IFN-1B** + **IFN-1a** to decrease relapses (30%) + decrease lesion accumulation in **active relapsing-remitting MS** (low power to delay disbility + minimal use in progressive MS)

- monoclonal antibodies - **alemtuzumab** + **natalizumab** to decrease relapses + decrease lesion accumulation in **active relapsing-remitting MS**

- non-immunosuppressive therapies - **glatiramer** + **mitoxantrone** help in **secondary progressive MS**, doxorubicin analogue, safety issues

- other drugs - **azathioprine** for relapsing-remitting MS (cheaper than interferons, ?just as good)

- palliation:

	- spasticity: **baclofen, diazepam, dantrolene, tizanidine** 
	
	- tremor: **botulinim toxin type A** injections
	
	- urgency/frequency: can teach intermittent **self-catheterisation**, or try **tolterodine**
