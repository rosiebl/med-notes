# PARKINSONISM


Parkinsonism is defined by a cardinal triad:

1. tremor

2. rigidity/hypertonia

3. bradykinesia/hypokinesia

### PRESENTATION

#### TREMOR

- worse at rest

- 'pill-rolling' of thumb over fingers

- 4-6 cycles/sec (slower than cerebellar tremor)

- distinguish from 'essential tremor', a symptomatic postural + action tremor of the upper limbs + head

#### RIGIDITY/HYPERTONIA

- rigidity + tremor gives '**cogwheel rigidity**'

- felt during rapid pronation/supination

#### BRADYKINESIA/HYPOKINESIA

Slow to initiate movement.

Slow, low-amplitude excursions in repetitive actions

- decreased blink rate

- monotonous hypophonic speech

- micrographia

**Gait**:

- decreased arm swing

- festinance: shuffling steps with flexed trunk, as if chasing one's centre of gravity
	
- freezing at obstacles or doors
	
Expressionless face: **hypomimesis**.

### CAUSES

- idiopathic Parkinson's disease (see notes)

- drugs

	- neuroleptics

	- metoclopramide

	- prochlorperazine

- rare causes:

	- trauma/boxing

	- encephalopathy post-flu

	- manganese or copper toxicity: Wilson's disease

	- HIV: HAART helps

	- Parkinson's-plus syndromes (see notes)
