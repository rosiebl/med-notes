# MOTOR NEURON DISEASE

Motor neuron disease (MND) is a group of major degenerative diseases characterised by **selective loss of neurons** in **motor cortex**, **cranial nerve nuclei**, and **anterior horn cells**.

**Upper + lower motor neurons** are affected.

No sensory loss + no sphincter disturbance: differentiates MND from MS or polyneuropathies.

Never affects eye movements: differentiates MND from myasthenia gravis.

Prevalence: 6/100,000.

F:M ~ 3:2

Median age of onset UK: 60y.

Often fatal in 2-4y.

### CLINICAL PATTERNS

#### ALS: AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS

Archetypal MND; 50%.

Loss of motor neurons in motor cortex + anterior horn of spinal cord.

Signs:

- weakness

- UMN signs e.g. upgoing plantars

- LMN signs e.g. wasting, fasciculation

- spilt hand sign: thumb's side of hand seems adrift due to excessive wasting around it - much less hypothenar wasting

Worse prognosis if:

- bulbar onset

- higher age

- lower FVC

87% of familial ALS explained by events at the ALS-FTD locus (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia locus on 9p21).

#### PROGRESSIVE BULBAR PALSY

10%.

Diseases of the nuclei of **cranial nerves IX-XII** in the medulla.

Signs are of LMN lesion of the tongue + muscles of talking + swallowing:

- flaccid, fasciculating tongue

- jaw jerk normal or absent

- speech quiet, hoarse or nasal

Causes of bulbar palsy:

- MND
- Guillain-Barre
- polio
- myasthenia gravis
- syringobulbia
- brainstem tumours
- centra pontine myelinolysis

#### PROGRESSIVE MUCULAR ATROPHY

10%.
Anterior horn cell lesion only, so no UMN signs.

Affects distal muscle groups before proximal.

Better prognosis than ALS.

#### PRIMARY LATERAL SCLEROSIS

Loss of Betz cells in the motor cortex.

Signs:

- mainly UMN

- marked spastic leg weakness

- pseudobulbar palsy

##### Pseudobulbar/corticobulbar palsy

UMN lesion of muscles of swallowing + talking (c.f. bulbar palsy, which is LMN).

Due to bilateral lesions above the mid-pons, e.g. corticobulbar tracts.

Causes:

- MS
- MND
- stroke
- central pontine myelinolysis

More common than bulbar palsy.

Signs:

- slow tongue movements

- slow deliberate speech

- increased jaw jerk

- increased pharyngeal + palatal reflexes

- psudoebulbar affect: weeping unprovoked by sorrow or mood-incongruent giggling

### PRESENTATION

Think of MND in those:

- 40y +

- stumbling spastic gait

- foot drop

- ± proximal myopathy

- weak grip and shoulder abduction

- aspiration pneumonia

Look for UMN signs:

- spasticity

- brisk reflexes

- upgoing plantars

Also LMN signs:

- wasting

- fasciculation of tongue, abdomen, back, thigh

- N.B. fasciculation insufficient to dx LMN lesion - also need weakness

Speech or swallow affected? --> bulbar signs.

Frontotemporal dementia occurs in ~25%.


### Dx CRITERIA

There is no diagnostic test.

- **brain/cord MRI** helps exclude structural causes.

- **LP** helps exclude inflammatory causes.

- **neurophysiology** can detect subclinical denervation + help exclude mimicking motor neuropathies

#### REVISED EL ESCORIAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR ALS

Definite: LMN + UMN signs in 3 regions.

Probable: LMN + UMN signs in 2 regions.

Probably with lab support: LMN + UMN signs in 1 region, or UMN signs in >1region + EMG showing acute denervation in >2 limbs.

Possible: LMN + UMN signs in 1 region.

Suspected: UMN or LMN signs only - in 1 region.

### MGMT

MDT approach is best: neurologist, palliative nurse, hospice, physio, OT, speech therapist, dietician, social services, coordinated by GP.

- Antiglutamatergic drugs - **riluzole** prolongs life ~3/12 (N.B. LFTs increase, do 3-monthly)

- Drooling: **propantheline**, **amitriptyline** thought to be effective by Drs, pts disagree

- Dysphagia: blend food, consider NG tube or PEG.

- Spasticity: as for MS, **baclofen, diazepam, dantrolene, tizanidine**

- Joint pains + distress: **analgesic ladder**

- Respiratory failure (± aspiration pneumonia and sleep apnoea): **NIV at home** in some pts
