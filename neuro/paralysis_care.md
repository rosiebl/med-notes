# CARE OF PARALYSED PATIENTS

Paralysis pts need special care.

Avoid **pressure sores**:

- turn pt
- review weight-bearing areas often

Avoid **thrombolysis** in paralysed limbs:

- frequent passive movement
- pressure stockings
- Â± low molecular weight heparin

**Bladder** care is vital:

- can catheterise, but not the only option
- do not control incontinence by reducing fluid intake

**Bowels**:

- evacuation may be manual or aided by suppositories
- increasing dietary fibre intake may help

**Exercise** of unaffected or partially paralysed limbs is important to avoid unnecessary loss of function.
