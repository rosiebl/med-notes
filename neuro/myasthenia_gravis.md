# MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

Myasthenia gravis is an **autoimmune** disease mediated by antibodies to **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors**, interfering with the **neuromuscular transmission** via **depletion of working post-synaptic receptor sites**.

B + T cells implicated.

### PRESENTATION

Presentation is with increasing muscle fatigue.

Muscle groups affected in order:

- extraocular

- bulbar: swallowing, chewing

- face

- neck

- limb girdle

- trunk

Signs:

- **ptosis**

- **diplopia**

- myasthenic snarl on smiling

- 'peek sign'

- counting to 50, **voice fades** (dysphonia is rare sign)

- **normal tendon reflexes**

Weakness worsened by:

- pregnancy

- hypokalaemia

- infection

- over-treatment

- change of climate

- emotion

- exercise

- gentamicin

- opiates

- tetracycline

- quinine

- procainamide

- B-blockers


### ASSOCIATIONS

Under 50y: 

- F > M

- associated with: 

	- other autoimmune disease

	- thymic hyperplasia

Over 50y: 

- M > F

- associated with:

	- thymic atrophy

	- thymic tumour

	- rheumatoid arthritis

	- SLE

### INVESTIGATIONS

**Antibodies**:

- anti-ACHhR antibodies raised in 90% (70% in ocular-confined MG)

- if seronegative, look for: 
	
	- MuSK antibodies
	
	- muscle specific tyrosine kinase
	
	- F:M 15:2
	
**Neurophysiology**: **decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve stimulation** Â± increased single-fibre jitter.

**Imaging**: CT of thymus.

Other:

- **ptosis** improves by >2mm after **ice application** to the closed affected lid for >2mins

- Tensilon test less used as gives less clean answers + has dangers

### MGMT

#### SYMPTOM CONTROL

**Anticholinesterase** e.g. **pyridostigmine**.

Cholinergic SE:

- increased salivation
- lacrimation
- sweats
- vomiting
- miosis

Other SE: diarrhoea, colic (controllable with **propantheline**).


#### IMMUNOSUPPRESSION

Treat relapses with **prednisolone**.

- start 5mg alternate days
- increase by 5mg/wk up to 1mg/kg on each Rx day
- decrease dose on remission
- may take months

Give **osteoporosis prohylaxis**.

SE: weakness, so low starting dose.

Can combine **steroids** with:

- **azathioprine** 2.5mg/kg/day
- **methotrexate** weekly

**IV methylprednisolone** has a role.

#### THYMECTOMY

Consider if:

- onset before 50y old

- disease not easily controlled by anticholinesterases

Remission in 25%; worthwhile benefit in further 50%.

Thymectomy also necessary for thymomas to prevent local invasion, but MG symptoms often unaffected.

Can give **IV immunoglobulin** 0.4g/kg daily for 5d pre-op.

### MYASTHENIC CRISIS

Weakness of respiratory muscles during a relapse can be life-threatening.

Monitor FVC.

**Ventilatory support** unlikely to be needed >20mL/kg vital capacity.

Mgmt:

- **plasmapheresis**
- **IV Ig**
- identify + treat trigger for relapse, e.g. infection, medication

### PROGNOSIS

Relapsing or slow progression.

If thymoma, 5y survival is 68%.

##### N.B. OTHER CAUSES OF MUSCLE FATIGABILITY

- polymyositis

- SLE

- Takayasu's arteritis: fatigability of the extremities

- botulism
