# INTRACRANIAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS

Thrombosis of the venous channels in the brain causes infarction of the brain. 

It is a relatively uncommon cause of infarction compared to arterial disease.

### CAUSES

**Common causes:**

- pregnancy/puerperium

- oral contraceptives

- head injury

- dehyfration

- blood dyscrasias

- intracranial malignancy: local invasion/pressure

- extracranial malignancy: hypercoagulability

- recent LP

**Systemic causes:**

- hyperthyroidism

- nephrosis

- ketoacidosis

- heart failure

- SLE

- homocystinuria

- hyperviscosity

- Crohn's or UC

- Behcet's disease

- activated protein C resistance

- antiphospholipid syndrome

- Klippel-Trenauny syndrome

- paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria

**Infectious causes:**

- meningitis

- TB

- cerebral abscess

- septicaemia

- fungal infections

- otitis media

- cerebral malaria

- HIV with nephrosis

**Drug causes:**

- androgens e.g. oxymetholone

- antifibrinolytics e.g. tranexamic acid

- infliximab

### DURAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS

Most commonly:

- **sagittal sinus thrombosis**: 47% of all IVT

- **transverse sinus thrombosis**: 35%

Sagittal sinus thrombosis often coexists if other sinuses are thrombosed.

Symptoms come on **gradually** over **days or weeks** and are dependent on the sinus affected.

Thrombosis within a dural venous sinus may extend into the cortical veins and cause and **infarction** within a venous territory.

#### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

**Sagittal sinus:**

- headache

- vomiting

- seizures

- loss of vision

- papilloedema

**Transverse sinus:**

- headache Â± mastoid pain

- focal CNS signs

- seizures

- papilloedema

**Sigmoid sinus:**

- cerebellar signs

- lower cranial nerve palsies

**Inferior petrosal sinus:**

- Vth + VIth cranial nerve palsies

- temporal + retro-orbital pain

- together comprise Gradenigo's syndrome

**Cavernous sinus:**

- often due to spread from facial pustules or folliculitis

- headache

- chemosis: swelling of the conjunctiva

- oedematous eyelids

- proptosis

- painful ophthalmoplegia

- fever

### CORTICAL VEIN THROMBOSIS

Often causes venous infarcts, with stroke-like focal symptoms that develop over days.

- Associated headache may come on suddenly: **thunderclap headache**.

- **Seizures common**, + focal (unlike in arterial stroke).

Usually occurs w/ sinus thromboses.

Galen vein thrombosis is a rare cause, usually associated with vascular malformation.

#### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

- encephalopathy

- focal seizures

- headache, incl. thunderclap headache

- slowly evolving focal deficits

	- paresis

	- speech disorders

	- decreased cognition

	- loss of vision

### DDx

- subarachnoid haemorrhage

- meningits

- encephalitis

- intracranial abscess

- arterial infarction

### INVESTIGATIONS

Exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage if thunderclap headache.

Check no signs of meningitis.

#### IMAGING

**CT/MRI venography**:

- may show absence of sinus
- absent transverse sinus can be normal variant

**MRI T2-weighted gradient echo sequences**:

- can identify thrombus directly
- can identify haemorrhagic infarction

**CT**:

- may be normal early on
- ~1wk develops the delta sign
	- transversely cut sinus shows contrast filling defect


#### LUMBAR PUNCTURE

Do unless contraindicated by MRI/CT.

Suspect cerebral vein thrombosis if:

- **raised opening CSF pressure**
- persistent headache
- subarachnoid haemorrhage excluded

CSF may be normal, or show:

- RBCs
- xanthochromia 

### MGMT

Expert help.

**Heparin** improves outcome, possibly even in haemorrhagic venous infarction.

**Fibrinolytics**, e.g. **streptokinase**, have been used via selective catheterisation.

Thrombophilia screen + ENT review to help identify the cause.

### PROGNOSIS

Variable.

Death mainly due to:

- transtentorial herniation 
- from unilateral focal mass effects
- diffuse oedema
- multiple parenchymal lesions

Independent predictors of death:

- coma
- deep cortical vein thrombosis
- posterior fossa lesion
- R intracerebral haemorrhage
- mental disturbance
- evolving focal deficits
