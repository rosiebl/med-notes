# GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME

Guillain-Barre syndrome is a type of acute inflammatory neuropathy, characterised by:

- motor difficulty

- absence of deep tendon reflexes

- parasthesias without objective sensory loss

- increased CSF albumin with absence of cellular reaction

	- albuminocytological dissociation

The most common type of Guillain-Barre syndrome in the UK is **acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy**.

Incidence: 1-2/1000,000/yr.

### TYPES OF GUILLAIN-BARRE

- acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy - most pts in UK, varies worldwide

- acute motor axonal neuropathy

- acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy

- Miller Fisher syndrome

- acute pandysautonomia

- pure sensory neuropathy


### ANTECEDENTS

The trigger causes antibodies which ttack nerves. 

In 40% no cause found.

- Campylobacter jejuni - commonest

- Mycoplasma pneumoniae

- cytomegalovirus

- Epstein-Barr virus

- varicella zoster virus

- hepatitis A + B

- HIV - may have high WCC in CSF

- transfusions, operations, vaccinations


### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS


- motor difficulty

- absence of deep tendon reflexes

- parasthesias without objective sensory loss

- pain e.g. back, limb

- autonomic dysfunction

	- sweating
	
	- increased pulse
	
	- BP changes
	
	- arrhythmias


Typically a few weeks after an infection a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness starts.

May advance quickly, affecting all limbs at once, and can lead to paralysis.

Proximal muscles more affected than distal, e.g. trunk, respiratory and cranial nerves, esp. VII (cf. other neuropathies).

Deficit is variable.

Pain is common but sensory signs may be absent.

Progressive phase of 4 weeks --> recovery. Monophasic disease (won't relapse).


### INVESTIGATIONS

Bloods:

- FBC
- ESR
- U&E (GBS is a cause of SIADH)
- LFTs
- other bloods e.g. Ig, ANA, toxins

Urine e.g. porphyrins.

CXR, ECG.

Respiratory function test: do FVC 4 hourly. Involvement requires ITU transfer.

#### NEURO INVESTIGATIONS

Nerve conduction studies: slow conduction. May be normal early on so not very helpful for dx.

CSF:

- **albumincytological dissociation**: hig protein without high WCC

- normal WCC

- high protein e.g. >5.5g/L 
	
N.B. in HIV pts may have high WCC.

### MGMT

IV **immunoglobulin** 0.4g/kg/24h for 5 days.

**Plasma exchange** also good (?SE).

No role for steroids.

Respiratory is the big danger and requires transfer to ITU. 

- Ventilate sooner rather than later, e.g. if:	
	- FVC <1.5L
	- PaO2 <10kPa
	- PaCO2 >6kPa

### PROGNOSIS

~85% complete or near-complete recovery.

10% unable to walk alone at 1y.

--> Complete paralysis is compatible with complete recovery.

Mortality 10%.
