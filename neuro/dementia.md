# DEMENTIA

Dementia is a syndrome encompassing progressive decline in cognition or behaviour from a prior level of functioning in one or more of:

- memory
- language
- visual processes
- executive functions
- social and interpersonal behaviour

Normal level of consciousness.

Initial presentaiton is usually of memory loss over months or years; if over days think infection or stroke; if over weeks think depression.

Later stages may include non-cognitive symptoms e.g. agitation, agression or apathy, which complicate care.

### PREVALENCE

Rare if <55y.

>65: 5-10%.

>80: 20%.

>100: 70%.

### DIAGNOSIS

#### HISTORY

Need good hx from pt and also collateral hx. Remember to ask about:

- timeline
- activities of daily living
- coping with financial affairs
- coping with medications

As well as memory loss there may be:

- agitation

- aggression

- wandering

- hallucinations

- flight of ideas

- logorrhoea

- slow repetitious speech

- apathy

- mood disturbance
	
	- NB. depression is common in dementia but can also cause cognitive impairment 

#### EXAMINATION

**Cognitive testing**: use a validated dementia screen e.g. AMTS or TYM, plus short tests of verbal recall and executive function.

**Mental state exam**: may reveal anxiety, depresison or hallucinations.

**Physical examination**: may reveal physical cause for cognitive impairment, risk factors (esp for vascular dementia) or parkinsonism.

#### INVESTIGATIONS

**Bloods**:

- FBC
- ESR
- U&E
- calcium
- LFT
- TSH
- autoantibodies
- B12/folate (treat low-normals)
- syphilis serology

**CT/MRI** for vascular damage, haemorrhage or structural pathology.

Consider also doing:

- EEG
- CSF
- functional imaging (FDG, PET, SPECT)

**Metabolic**, **genetic** and **HIV** tests if indicated.

### CAUSES

Common causes:

- Alzheimer's disease (60-65%)

- Vascular dementia (10-15%)

- Dementia with Lewy bodies
	
- Frontotemporal dementia

- Parkinson's disease with dementia

Other causes:

- alcohol/drug abuse

- repeated head trauma

- Huntington's

- CJD

- Parkinson's

- progressive supranuclear palsy

- familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer's

- CADASIL: Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy

Senile dementia is no longer a dx.

#### AMELIORABLE CAUSES

- hypothyroid

- low B12/folate

- low thiamine (e.g. alcohol)

- syphilis

- tumours (meningioma)

- subdural haematoma

- Parkinson's

- CNS cysticercosis

- HIV (Â± cryptococcosis)

- normal pressure hydrocephalus

- Whipple's disease

- Pellagra


### ALZHEIMER'S
Leading cause of dementia: 60-65%.

Onset may be from 40y (earlier in Down's syndrome, in which Alzheimer's disease is inevitable).

Alzheimer's disease is an insidious onset progressive disorder that results in memory loss, personality changes, **global cognitive dysfunction**, and functional impairments.

- visuo-spatial skill lost
- memory
- verbal abilities
- executive function
- anosognosia: lack of insight into the problems caused by the disease

NB. Unlike the other dementias, which may affect only certain domains, Alzheimer's causes global cognitive impairment.

Later there may be:

- irritability
- mood disturbance - depression or euphoria
- behavioural change e.g. aggression, wandering, disinhibition
- psychosis - hallucinations or delusiosn
- agnosia - may not recognise self in mirror

No standard natural history: cognitive impairment is preogressive but non-cognitive symptoms may come and go over months.

At the end, often but not invariably, pts become sedentary with little interest in anything.

#### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

- accumulation of B-amyloid peptide: degradation product of amyloid precursor protein

- progressive neuronal damage

- **neurofibrillary tangles**

- increased numbers of **amyloid plaques**

- loss of acetylcholine neurotransmitter

Neuronal loss selective. Most vulnerable:

- hippocampus
- amygdala
- temporal neocortex
- subcortical nuclei

Vacular effects also important

#### RISK FACTORS

- 1st degree relative with AD

- Down's syndroem

- homozygosity for apolipoprotein e e4 allele

- PICALM, CL1 + CLU mutations

- decreased physical + cognitive activity

- depression

- loneliness (simply living alone not a risk factor)

- smoking may accelerate onset

### NON-ALZHEIMER'S TYPES OF DEMENTIA

#### VASCULAR DEMENTIA

25% of all dementias.

Represents cumulative effects of many small strokes.

Sudden onset and stepwise progression is characterstic, but often hard to recognise.

Look for evidence of vascular pathology e.g. HTN, past strokes, focal CNS signs.

#### DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES

3rd commonest cause. 15-25%.

Typically with:

- fluctuating cognitive impairment

- detiled visual hallucinations e.g. small animals or children (worsen with haloperidol!)

- later, parkinsonism

Histology characterised by Lewy bodies in brainstem and neocortex.

- Lewy bodies are eosinophilic intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusion bodies.


#### FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA

(Also called Pick's dementia).

Frontal and temporal atrophy witout Alzheimer's histology.

Genes on chromosome 9 are important, as in motor neurone disease.

Signs:

- executive function impairment (e.g. planning, multitasking)

- behavioural/personality change

- early preservation of episodic memory and spatial orientation

- disinhibition (also see cases of artistic improvement)

- lack of insight into own condition

- hyperorality

- stereotyped behaviour

- emotional unconcern

- change in dietary habits - more interest in sweet foods

3 variants:

- behavioural FTD
- language variants:
	- semantic dementia
	- progressive non-fluent aphasia

Parkinsonism relatively common.



### MGMT

#### PRACTICAL ISSUES

Pts become increasingly dependent and develop increasingly complex needs as the disease progresses. Most will experience behavioural or psychological symptoms at some stage, which can be particularly distressing for the carer.

Issues to consider:

- a care coordinator to help organise the special help available

- capacity

- develop routines e.g. house keys kept in same place

- plan ahead

- day services

- care for the carer

- challenging behaviour - can consider trazodone or lorazepam if non-drug  options fail and pain/infection ruled out

- depression is common - can try an SSRI or if severe mirtazapine

- avoid drugs that impair cognition

#### PHARMACOLOGICAL MGMT


**Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors**:

	--> donepezil
	
	--> rivastigmine
	
	--> galantamine

- modestly effective for Alzheimer's

- some evidence for efficacy in dementia of Parkin's disease

- **rivastigmine** may improve behavioural symptoms in Lewy body dementia

May exacerbate peptic ulcer disease and heart block - always ask about dyspepsia and cardiac symptoms.

**Antiglutaminergic treatment**: **memantine** (NMDA antagonist) reasonably effective in late stage disease.
