# POST-ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF STROKE

### INVESTIGATION OF RISK FACTORS FOR PREVENTION

For immediate investigations, see notes on acute mgmt of stroke.

Investigate promptly to identify risk factors for further strokes. 

Hypertension:

- look for retinopathy, nephropathy, big heart on **CXR**
- raised BP common in early stroke - generally don't treat acutely

Cardiac source of emboli:

- **24h ECG** to look for AF
- **CXR**: enlarged L atrium
- **Echocardiogram**: 
	- mural thrombus due to AF or post-MI
	- valvular leasions in infective endocarditis or rheumatic heart disease
	- transoesophageal more sensitive than transthoracic

Carotid artery stenosis:

- **carotid Doppler ultrasound Â± CT/MRI angiography**
- 70% and over stenosis significant

**Bloods**:

- hypoglycaemia
- hyperglycaemia
- dyslipidaemia
- hyperhomocysteinaemia

Vasculitis:

- high ESR
- ANA +ve

**VDRL** to look for active, untreated syphilis.

Prothrombotic states e.g. thrombophilia, antiphospholipid syndrome.

Hyperviscosity e.g. polycythaemia, sickle cell disease.

Thrombocytopenia and other bleeding disorders.

**Genetic tests**:

- CADASIL
- Fabry's disease (X linked but some women also affected)


### PREVENTION

#### PRIMARY PREVENTION

i.e. before any stroke.

**Control risk factors** (see above) - treat:

- hypertension

- diabetes mellitus

- hyperlipidaemia: statins reduce risk by ~17%

- cardiac disease

**Exercise** helps: increases HDL + glucose tolerance.

**Folate** supplements may help somewhat: decrease homocysteine.

Help **quit smoking**.

**Anticoagulation**:

- lifelong if rheumatic or prostethetic heart valves on L side
- consider in chronic non-rheumatic AF, esp if other vascular risk factors

#### SECONDARY PREVENTION

i.e. preventing further strokes.

Control risk factors as in primary prevention.

Considerable advantage from lowering blood pressure + cholesterol, even if not particularly raised.

**Antiplatelet agents after stroke:**

- if no primary haemorrhage on CT
- **clopidogrel** monotherapy
- best way to prevent CNS + heart events

Anticoagulation after stroke:

- start **warfarin** if indicated
- 2 weeks after stroke
- use antiplatelet rx until anticoagulated
- if already anticoagulated, replace with antiplatelet for 1 week

### ENABLEMENT APPROACH

Understanding an individual's past abilities is as important as knowing about present disabilities.

Summary of the enablement approach:

- give equal weight to assessing physical and cognitive function

- agree the tasks to be done with the pt

- assess the risks involved in each task - how can they be reduced or avoided

- plan each small step: agree realistis + relevant goals, that can be acheived soon

- frequently review and reset specific goals

### EARLY MANAGEMENT TO IMPROVE LONG TERM OUTCOMES

6 points in the early mgmt of stroke which bear on later plans:

1. assess the pt's swallowing

	- if signs of aspiration (cough/voice change), make **nil by mouth** until formal assessment by **speech therapist**

	- use IV fluids, then semi-solids e.g. jelly (avoid soups + crumbly foods)
	
2. avoid falls and damaging pt's shoulders through careless lifting

3. ensure good bladder + bowel care through frequent toileting

	- avoid early catheterisation: may prevent return to continence

4. position to minimise spasticity: occurs in ~40%

	- get prompt physiotherapy
	
	- botulinum toxin injections helpful for focal spasticity

5. measure time take to sit up, and to transfer from lying to sitting in a chair

	- good way to monitor progress with physio/occupational therapy
	
6. in pseudo-emotionalism/emotional lability, tricyclics or fluoxetine may help

	- sobbing unprovoked by sorrow, from failure of cortical inhibition of the limbic system
	
Involve the carer/spouse with all aspects of care-giving: good rehab saves lives.

**Consider end of life decisions**.

N.B. Making physio fun aids motivation, e.g. swimming, music and video games. Aim is to promote cerebral reorganisation.

Constraint of the good arm may be helpful: constraint-induced movement therapy.

### TESTS TO ASSESS FUNCTION

Perceptual function: ask to name part of the body.

Spatial ability: copying matchstick patterns.

Apraxia (inability to perform particular purposive actions): dressing or copying a clock face.

Agnosia (inability to interpret sensations and hence to recognize things):  picking out and naming easy objects from a pile.

- acuity OK
- cannot mime use
- guesses are way off semantically + phonetically

Screen for depression: low mood, inability to feel pleasure or concentrate.

### PROGNOSIS

Key to have:

- good nursing on stroke unit
- antiplatelet agents
- prompt intervention

Minor stroke/TIA: urgent assessment + treatment saves lives.

Overall mortality: 60,000/year; UK 20% at 1 month, then <10%/year

Full recovery: <40%.

Drowsiness ~ poor prognosis.

Complications:

- aspiration pneumonia
- contractures
- constipation
- depression
- stress in spouse, e.g. alcoholism
