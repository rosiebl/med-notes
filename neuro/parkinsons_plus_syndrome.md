# PARKINSON'S-PLUS SYNDROME

Parkinson's-plus syndrome is a group of neurodegenerative diseases featuring the classical features of Parkinson's (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) with additional features which distinguish them from idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

Also known as disorders of multiple system degeneration.

Parkinson's plus syndromes:

- progressive supranuclear palsy

- multiple system atrophy

- Lewy body dementia

- cortico-basal degeneration

- vascular parkinsonism

### PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY

(PSP, Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome).

Early postural instability + vertical gaze palsy Â±:

- falls

- rigidity of trunk > in limbs

- symmetrical onset

- speech + swallowing problems

- little tremor

### MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY

(MSA, Shy-Drager).

Early autonomic features, e.g.:

- impotence

- incontinence

- postural hypotension

- cerebellar + pyrimidal signs

- rigidity > tremor

### LEWY BODY DEMENTIA

- fluctuating cognition

- visual hallucinations

- early dementia

### CORTICO-BASAL DEGENERATION

- akinetic rigidity involving one limb

- cortical sensory loss, e.g. astereogenesis

- apraxia

Can even have autonomous interfering activity by affected limb - 'alien limb' phenomenon.

### VASCULAR PARKINSONISM

Pyramidal signs (legs), e.g. in diabetic/hypertensive patient who falls or has gait problems.

e.g. ataxia w/o festination.

2-5% of "Parkinson's disease".
