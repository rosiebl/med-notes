# WEAK LEGS

There are many causes of weak legs, including cord compression.

5 questions to help with Dx:

1. Was onset sudden? (Sudden/progressive weakness is an emergency).

2. Are the legs flaccid or spastic?

3. Is there sensory loss? Sensory level usually means spinal cord disease.

4. Is there a loss of sphincter control (bowels, bladder)?

5. Any signs of infection, e.g. extradural abscess (tender spine, raised temp, high WCC/ESR/CRP)?

### CAUSES OF LEG WEAKNESS

(Not including cord compression - see other notes).

#### UNILATERAL FOOT DROP

- diabetes mellitus
- common peroneal nerve palsy
- stroke
- prolpased disc
- MS

#### WEAK LEGS WITH NO SENSORY LOSS

- motor neuron disease
- polio
- parasagittal meningioma (an exception to the rule that weak legs mean cord or distal lesion)

#### CHRONIC SPASTIC PARAPARESIS

- MS
- cord tumour: astrocytoma, haemangioblastoma, epndymoma
- cord metastases
- motor neuron disease
- syringomyelia
- subacute combined degeneration of the cord (vitamin B12 deficiency)
- hereditary spastic paraparesis
- taboparesis
- histiocytosis X
- parasites

#### CHRONIC FLACCID PARAPARESIS

- peripheral neuropathy
- myopathy (rare - arms alos involved)

#### ABSENT KNEE JERKS + EXTENSOR PLANTARS

- combined cervical + lumbar disc disease
- conus medullaris lesions
- motor neuron disease
- Friedrich's ataxia
- subacute combined degeneration of the cord (vitamin B12 deficiency)
- taboparesis
