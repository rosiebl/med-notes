# SUBDURAL HAEMORRHAGE

Subdural haemorrhage is bleeding into the subdural space, between the dural and arachnoid meninges.

Subdural haematoma is a collection of blood in the subdural space.

Consider in all whose conscious level fluctuates, and also in those having an evolving stroke, especially if on anticoagulants.

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Bleeding is from bridging veins between cortex + venous sinuses.

- bridging veins vulnerable to deceleration injury

Results in accumulating haematoma between dura + arachnoid.

Gradually raises intracranial pressure:

- **shifts midline** structures away from side of clot

- if untreated, eventual **tentorial herniation** + **coning**

### CAUSES

Most subdurals from trauma.

N.B. Trauma often forgotten as it was minor or a long time ago - up to 9/12.

Can occur without trauma, e.g. decreased intracranial pressure, dural metastases.

### RISK FACTORS

Elderly most susceptible: brain atrophy makes bridging veins vulnerable.

Other risk factors:

- falls
	- elderly
	- alcoholics
- anticoagulation

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS 

Fluctuating level of consciousness (seen in 35%) ±:

- insidious physical or intellectual slowing

- sleepiness

- headache

- personality change

- unsteadiness

Signs:

- raised intracranial pressure

- seizures

Localising neurological symptoms, e.g. unequal pupils, hemiparesis, occur late + often long after injury (mean = 63d).

### IMAGING

**CT/MRI** shows clot ± midline shift.

Beware bilateral isodense clots.

Loof for cresentic colelction of blood over 1 hemisphere: sickle shape differentiates subdural blood from extradural haemorrhage.

### DDx

- stroke

- dementia

- CNS masses e.g. tumours, abscess, neurocysticercosis

### MGMT

1st line: **irrigation/evacuation**, e.g. via burr twist drill + burr hole craniostomy.

2nd line: **craniostomy**, if clot has organised.

Adress cause of trauma.
