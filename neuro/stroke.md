# STROKE

Stroke is defined as an acute neurological deficit lasting >24h and caused by cerebrovascular aetiology.

Divided into:

- ischaemic stroke, caused by vascular occlusion or stenosis (85%)

- haemorrhagic stroke, caused by vascular rupture leading to intra-parenchymal and/or subarachnoid haemorrhage (15%)

Mortality after 1st stroke is 12% by day 56 (falling).

Incidence is falling: 1/1000/yr.

### CAUSES

Common causes:

- small vessel occlusion/cerebral microangiopathy or thrombosis in situ

- cardiac emboli (see below)

- atherothromboembolism, e.g. from carotids

- CNS bleeds

	- hypertension

	- trauma

	- aneurysm rupture

	- anticoagulation

	- thrombolysis

Other causes (esp important to consider in young pts):

- boundary zone/watershed stroke: sudden BP drop by >40, e.g. in sepsis

- carotid artery dissection: spontaneous, or from neck trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia

- vasculitis

- subarachnoid haemorrhage

- venous sinus thrombosis: acute vnous infarct

- antiphospholipid syndrome

- thrombophilia

- Fabry's disease

- CADASIL: cerebral auosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical 
infarcts + leucoencephalopathy

- CARASIL: autosomal recessive


#### CARDIAC CAUSES

Cardioembolic causes are the source of stroke in >30% of patietns.

May recur unless preventative measures are taken.

**Non-valvular atrial fibrillation**: 

- 4.5% risk of stroke/yr
- additive risks: age, prior stroke/TIA, diabetes, HTN
- ischaemic strokes often worse in AF than in sinus rhythm
- assess risk with CHAD-VASc score
- warfarin used for primary + secondary prevention

**External cardioversion**: 1-3% complicated by peripheral emboli. SImilar risk to pharamcological conversion.

**Prosthetic valves**: risk major embolli. Anticolagulate with target INR 3.5-4.5.

**Acute MI**:

- large LV wall motion abnormalities on echo predispose to LV thrombus
- emboli in 10% in next 6-12 months
- warfarin anticoagulation reduces risk by 2/3

**Paradoxical systemic emboli**: via venous circulation in those with patent foramen ovale, atrial and ventricular septal defects.

**Cardiac surgery**, e.g. bypass graft, carries risk: 0.9-5.2%.

**Valve vegetations from SBE/IE**:

- vegetations may emobliza
- 20% w/ endocarditis present with CNS signs



### MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS

- hypertenison

- smoking

- diabetes mellitus

- heart disease - valvular, ischaemic, AF (see below)

- peripheral vascular disease

- past TIA

- high packed cell volume

- carotid bruit

- the pill

- high lipids

- high alcohol use

- increased clotting, e.g. high plasma fibrinogen, low antithrombin III

- high homocysteine

- syphilis

### SIGNS

Onset: sudden, maybe with further progression over hours (rarely days).

Focal signs relate to distribution of the affected artery but collaterals cloud the issue.

Pointers to bleeding | Pointers to ischaemia
--- | ---
meningism | carotid bruit
severe headache | AF
coma within hours | past TIA
 | ischaemic heart disease

#### CEREBRAL INFARCTS

50%

Depends on site.

may be contralateral sensory loss or hemiplegia:

- initially flaccid: floppy limb, falls like dead weight when lifted

- becoming spastic: UMN

- dysphasia

- homonymous hemianopia

- visuo-spatial deficit

#### BRAINSTEM INFARCTS

25%

Wide range of effects. Includes:

- quadriplegia

- disturbances of gaze and vision

- locked-in syndrome: aware, but not able to respond

#### LACUNAR INFARCTS

25%

In basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons.

5 syndromes:

- ataxic hemiparesis

- pure motor

- pure sensory

- sensorimotor

- dysarthria/clumsy hand

Cognition/consciousness intact except thalamic stroke.

### DDX

- head injury

- hypo/hyperglycaemia

- subdural haemorrhage

- intracranial tumours

- hemiplegic migraine

- epilepsy (Todd's palsy)

- CNS lymphoma

- pneumocephalus; air entry via otitis or mastoid air cells

- Wernicke's encephalopathy

- drug overdose (if coma)

- hepatic encephalopathy

- mitochondrial cytopathies

- herpes encephalitis

- HIV; HTLV1; toxoplasmosis

- abscesses e.g. typhoid

- mycotic aneurysm

- Coccidioides immitis

- acanthamoeba/naegleria
