# MYOPATHIES

### Dx

#### MYOPATHY VS. NEUROPATHY

Features which make a diagnosis of myopathy or neuropathy more or less likely:

Feature | Myopathy | Neuropathy
-- | -- | --
Onset | gradual onset | can be rapid onset
Weakness | proximal weakness (N.B. myotonic dystrophy), usually selective on presentation | distal weakness
Distribution | symmetrical | can be aysmmetrical
Reflexes | preserved tendon reflexes | may be absent
Sensation | may experience pain | parasthesiae
Other | | bladder problems


gradual onset of symmetrical proximal weakness

e.g. difficulty combing hair, climbing stairs

usually affect specific muscle groups, i.e. selective weakness on first presentation

preserved tendon reflexes

can be rapid onset

#### SPECIFIC FEATURES

There is usually a gradual onset of symmetrical proximal weakeness, e.g. difficulty combing hair or climbing stairs.

N.B. weakness is also distal in **myotonic dystrophy**.


- Spontaneous pain at rest + local tenderness: **inflammatory myopathies**.

- Pain on exercise: ischaemia or metabolic myopathy, e.g. **McArdle's disease**.

- Oddly firm muscles: due to infiltration ith fat or connective tissue. Suggests **pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophies**, e.g. **Duchenne's**.

#### FEATURES SUGGESTIVE OF NON-MYOPATHIC DISEASE

Lumps commonly caused by haematoma, herniation of muscle through fascia, and tendon rupture. Muscle tumours rare.

Excess fatigability (increased weakness w/ exercise) suggests myasthenia gravis (neuromuscular junction defect, not a myopathy).

Fasciculation suggests anterior horn cell or root disease.

### INVESTIGATIONS

**Bloods** which may be raised:

- ESR
- CK
- AST
- LDH

**EMG**.

Do tests that are relevant to systemic causes e.g. TSH.

Many genetic disorders of muscle detectable by DNA analysis: use muscle biopsy only if genetic tests are non-diagnostic.

### MUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES

Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic diseases with progressive degeneration and weakness of specific muscle groups.

Primary abnormality may be in muscle membrane.

Secondary effects:

- marked variation in size of individual muscle fibres

- deposition of fat + connective tissue

#### DUCHENNE'S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

Most common form of muscular dystrophy.

3/1000 male live births.

Sex-linked recessive, 30% from spontaneous mutation.

Duchenne gene is on short arm of X (Xp665) and product - dystrophin - in non-functional.

Presentation:

- ~4yo

- clumsy walking

- then difficulty standing

- respiratory failure

- pseudohypertrophy, especially in calves

Serum CK increased >40x.

Prognosis:

- no specific Rx.

- some survive beyond 20y.

- home ventilation improves prognosis

- genetic counselling vital



#### BECKER'S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

~0.3/1000 male births.

Results from Duchenne gene malfunction which produces partially-functioning dystrophin.

Presents with similar but milder symptoms, at later age, with better prognosis.

#### FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (LANDOUZY-DEJERINE)

Almost as common as Duchenne's.

Inheritance: autosomal dominant (locus 4q35).

Presentation:

- onset ~12-14yo

- inability to puff out cheeks

- difficulty raising arms above head

Signs:

- weakness of face - 'ironed-out' expression

- weakness of shoulders + upper arms - often asymmetric w/ deltoids spared

- foot drop

- scapular winging

- scoliosis

- anterior axillary folds

- horizontal clavicles

<20% need wheelchair by 40yo.

### MYOTONIC DISORDERS

Myotonic disorders cause tonic muscle spasm: myotonia.

Histology: long chains of central nuclei within muscle fibres.

Chief disorders is **dystrophia myotonica**, an autosomal dominant Cl- channelopathy.

Na+ channelopathies: **paramyotonia congenita**, **adynamia episodica hereditaria**.

Typical presentation:

- 25yo

- distal-onset weakness: hand/foot drop

- weak sternomastoids

- myotonia

- facial weakness + wasting --> long, haggard appearance

Other signs:

- cataracts

- male frontal baldness

- diabetes

- testis/ovary atrophy

- cardiomyopathy

- decreased cognition

Most die in middle age of intercurrent illness.

**Mexiletine, phenytoin + acetazolamide** may help.

Genetic counselling important.

### ACQUIRED MYOPATHIES OF LATE ONSET

Often part of systemic disease, e.g.:

- hyperthyroidism

- malignancy

- Cushing's

- hypo- and hypercalcaemia

### INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES

If over 50 cheif example is **inclusion body myositis**.

Aggregates of Alzheimer tau proteins suggest a **'peripheral tauopathy'**.

Signs:

- weakness

- starts with quads, finger flexors or pharyngeal muscles

- ventral extremity muscle groups more affected than dorsal or rigdal groups

Wheelchair dependency <3%.

Rx: nothing consistently effective.

### DRUG CAUSES

- alcohol

- statins

- steroids

- chloroquine

- zidovudine

- vincristine

- cocaine
