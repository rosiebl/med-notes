# EPILEPSY

Epilepsy is a recurrent tendency to spontaneous, intermittent, abnormal electrical activity in part of the brain, manifesting as seizures.

Seizures take many forms but tend to be sterotyped to a pt.

Convulsions: motor signs of electrical discharges.

Prevalence of active epilepsy ~1%.

(Most people would have a seizure in abnormal metabolic circumstances - does not = epilepsy). 

### SEIZURE

**Prodrome**: 

- may rarely precede seizure. 
- lasts hours or days
- pt or others notice change in mood or behaviour.

**Aura**: 

- part of the seizure which pt is aware of
- may precede other manifestations
- e.g. strange gut feeling, deja vu, strange smells, flashing lights
- implies partial seizure

**Seizure**:

- may take many forms
- see classification

**Post-ictal**:

- phase after stroke
- may be:
	- headache
	- confusion
	- myalgia
	- sore tongue (biting)
	- Todd's palsy: temporary weakness after focal seizure in motor cortex
	- dysphasia following focal seizure in temporal lobe

### CAUSES

2/3 idiopathic, often familial.

#### Structural

- cortical scarring, e.g. head injury years before onset

- developmental e.g. dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour or cortical dysgenesis

- space-occupying lesion

- stroke

- hippocampal sclerosis e.g. after a febrile convulsion

- vascular malformations

#### Others

- tuberous sclerosis

- sarcoidosis

- SLE

- polyarteritis nodosum

#### Non-epileptic causes of seizures

- trauma

- stroke

- haemorrhage

- raised intracranial pressure

- alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal

- liver disease

- raised temperature

- pseudoseizures

Metabolic disturbance:

- hypoxia
- hypo- or hypernatraemia
- hypocalcaemia
- hypo- or hyperglycaemia
- uraemia

Infection:

- meningitis
- encephalitis
- syphilis
- cysticercosis
- HIV

Drugs:

- tricyclics
- cocaine
- tramadol
- theophylline


### DX

#### HX

**Are these really seizures?** Important to establish from detailed history. Tongue-biting and slow recovery are very suggestive.

**What type of seizure is it?** Partial vs generalised (see seizure classification below). 

**Are there any triggers?**

For a first-ever seizure:

- **is it really the first?** get collateral hx
- **was the seizure provoked?**
- prompt investigation (see below)

#### TRIGGERS VS. PROVOCATION

Examples of triggers for seizures:

- alcohol
- stress
- fevers
- certain sounds
- flickering lights/TV
- contrasting patterns
- reading/writing

Examples of provocations for seizures: metabolic disturbances, infection, drugs (see causes above).

Provocations are different to triggers: most people would have a seizure given sufficient provocation, but most people do not have seizures however many triggers they are exposed to.  --> triggered seizures suggest epilepsy.

Provoked 1st seizures are less likely to recur (3-10% unless cause irreversible).

In unprovoked 1st seizures, recurrence rates are 30-50%.

#### INVESTIGATIONS

After a first seizure, prompt investigations should include:

- bloods to screen possible causes
- drugs screen
- LP if safe
- EEG: unequivocal epileptiform activity helps assess recurrence risk
- CT/MRI + enhancement (or may miss infective causes)

NB. EEG cannot exclude or refute epilepsy and are often falsely +ve so don't do if simple syncope is likely dx.

#### NON-EPILEPTIC ATTACK DISORDER

Pseudo- or psychogenic seizures.

Non infrequent.

Suspect if uncontrollable symptoms, no learning disabilities, normal CNS exam, MRI and EEG.

May coexist with true epilepsy.

### SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION

NB. classification of epileptic syndromes is separate to the classification of seizures: based on seizure type, age of onset, EEG findings + other features like FHx.

#### PARTIAL SEIZURES

Focal onset, with features referable to a part of one hemisphere.

--> the *onset* of the attack is key: if onset is focal then the seizure is partial, however rapidly it then generalises.

##### Simple partial seizure

- awareness unimpaired

- focal motor, sensory, autonomic or psychic symptoms

- no post-ictal symptoms

##### Complex partial seizure

- awareness imparied

- may have simple partial onset (aura) or impaired awareness at onset

Most commonly from temporal lobe - often with post-ictal confusion.

Recovery rapid after frontal lobe seizures.


##### Partial seizure with secondary generalisation

Electrical disturbance starts focally (as a simple or complex partial seizure) but spreads widely causing a secondary generalised seizure.

Typically convulsive.

2/3 of patients with partial seizures.

#### PRIMARY GENERALISED SEIZURES

Simultaneous onset of electrical discharge throughout cortex, with no localising features referable to only one hemisphere.

##### Absence seizures

- brief pauses (<10s)

- e.g. stops talking mid-sentence then carries on where left off

- presents in childhood

##### Tonic-clonic seizures

- loss of consciousness

- tonic: limbs stiffen

- clonic: jerking movements

- can be tonic, clonic or tonic-clonic

- post-ictal confusion and drowsiness

##### Myoclonic seizures

- sudden jerk of limb, face or trunk

- pt may have violently disobedient limb or be thrown to the ground

- 'flying saucer epilepsy'

##### Atonic (akinetic) seizures

- sudden loss of muscle tone causing a fall

- no loss of consciousness

##### Infantile spasms

- commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis

### LOCALISING FEATURES

#### TEMPORAL LOBE

**Automatisms**: 

- complex motor phenomena
- impaired awareness
- no recollection afterwards
- wide range
- primitive oral movements e.g. lip-smacking, chewing, swallowing
- manual movements e.g. fumbling, fiddling, grabbing
- complex actions e.g. singing, kissing, driving a car and violent acts

**Abdominal** rising sensation or pain, ± ictal vomiting; rarely episodic fevers or D+V.

**Dysphasia**: ictal or post-ictal.

**Memory phenomena**: deja vu or jamais vu (everything unfamiliar). 

**Hippocampal involvement**: **emotional disturbance** e.g. sudden terror, panic, anger or elation, and derealisation (out-of-body experience). May present as excessive religiosity.

**Uncal involvement**: **hallucinations** of smell or taste + dreamlike state.

**Auditory complex**: complex **auditory hallucinations** e.g. music, conversations or palinacousis (hearing sound after has finished).

**Delusional behaviour**.

#### FRONTAL LOBE

**Motor features**: posturing, versive movements of the head ande yes, peddling movements of the legs.

**Jacksonian march**: spreading focal motor seizure with retained awareness, often starting with face or thumb.

**Motor arrest**.

Subtle **behavioural disturbances**, often dx as psychogenic.

**Post-ictal Todd's palsy** (temporary weakness after focal seizure in motor cortex).

#### PARIETAL LOBE

**Sensory disturbances**: tingling, numbness, pain (rare).

**Motor symptoms**: due to spread to the pre-central gyrus.

#### OCCIPITAL LOBE

**Visual phenomena** e.g. spots, lines, flashes.


### MGMT

#### COUNSELLING

Dangerous acitivites include e.g. baths, swimming, driving, heights.

Avoid driving until seizure free for >1y - must contact DVLA.

Include pts in all decisions re mgmt.

#### DRUGS

##### WHEN TO START RX

Don't recommend drugs after one fit unless high risk of recurrence (e.g. structural brin lesion, focal CNS deficit, unequivocal epileptiform EEG).

After 2nd fit discuss options with the pt - drugs probably indicated provided specialist has confirmed dx.

If only 1 fit/2y, may choose to accept risk to avoid drugs, as long as no driving/operating machinery.

##### DRUG CHOICE

Drug choice dependent on:

- seizure type
- epilepsy syndrome
- other medications
- comorbidities
- plans for pregnancy
- patient choice

Recommended drugs:

	GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES
	
	1st: sodium valproate / lamotrigine
	~
	2nd: carbamazepine / topiramate
	~
	others: levetiracetam / oxcarbazepine / clobazam
	
-

	ABSENCE SEIZURES
	
	sodium valproate / lamotrigine / ethosuximide
	
-

	TONIC, ATONIC + MYOCLONIC SEIZURES
	
	1st: sodium valproate / lamotrigine
	~
	2nd:  topiramate
	~
	others: levetiracetam / clobazam
	
-

	PARTIAL SEIZURES ± SECONDARY GENERALISATION
	
	1st: carbamazepine
	~
	2nd: sodium valproate / lamotrigine / oxcarbazepine / topiramate
	~
	others: levetiracetam / gabapentin / tiagabine / phenytoin / clobazam

Treat with **1** drug.

Slowly build up doses over 2-3/12 until seizures controlled, side-effects are bad or maximum dose reached.

If ineffective or not tolerated, switch to next most appropriate drug.

To switch introduce new drug and only withdraw 1st drug when 2nd drug established.

Dual rx necessary in <10% pts - consider if all drugs have been tried at optimum dose.

Most pts seizure-free within a few years of starting drugs - >50% remain so when drugs withdrawn.

#### SURGERY

If single epileptogenic focus can be found, neurosurgical resection offers up to 70% chance of seizure freedom, depending on location of focus.

Risks of focal neurological deficits.

Alternative: vagal nerve stimulation can reduce seizure frequency and severity in 33%.

### SUDEP

**Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy**.

More common in uncontrolled epilepsy, may be related to nocturnal seizure-associated apnoea or asystole.

People with epilepsy have 3x mortality rate of controls.

Up to 17% pf epilepsy-related deaths per year in the UK are SUDEP.
