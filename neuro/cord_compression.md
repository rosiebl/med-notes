# CORD COMPRESSION

Cord compression usualy presents with weak legs.

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

**Spinal or root pain** may precede **leg weakness** + **sensory loss**.

**Arm weakness** often less severe.

**Bladder (and anal) sphincter involvement** is late, manifests as:

- hesitancy
- frequency
- painless rentention (later)

Signs:

- motor, reflex + sensory level

- normal findings above level of lesion

- **LMN signs at level** (esp in cervical cord compression)

- **UMN signs below the level**

	- but remember tone + reflexes usually reduced in **acute** cord compression
	
### CAUSES

Most common: **secondary malignancy in spine** (from breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney).

Rarer:

- infection - epidural abscess

- cervical disc prolapse

- haematoma (warfarin)

- intrinsic cord tumour

- atlanto-axial subluxation

- myeloma

Occasionally non-spinal causes, e.g. bilateral frontal lobe infarcts, parasagittal meningioma.

#### DDx

- transverse myelitis

- MS

- carcinomatous meningitis

- cord vasculitis - polyarteritis nodosum, syphilis

- spinal artery thrombosis

- trauma

- dissecting aneurysm

- Guillain-Barre (not a cord pathology)

### INVESTIGATIONS

Do not delay imaging.

**MRI** is definitive modality.

Spinal X ray unreliable.

**Biopsy** or **surgical exploration** may be needed to identify nature of any mass.

**Screening blood tests**:

- FBC
- ESR
- B12
- syphilis serology
- U&E
- LFT
- PSA
- serum electrophoresis

Do **CXR**: primary lung malignancy, lung secondaries, TB.


### MGMT

If malignancy, give **dexamethasone IV** 4mg/6h while considering specific appropriate therapy.

e.g. **radiotherapy or chemotherapy Â± decompressive laminectomy**.

Epidural abscess must be **decompressed** + **Abx** given.
