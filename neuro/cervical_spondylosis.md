# CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS

Cervical spondylosis is the specific term for osteoarthritis of the spine, including the spontaneous degeneration of either disc or facet joints.

Can lead to arthritis-specific symptoms referable to the neck or neurological complications of joint degeneration:

- cervical spondylotic **myelopathy** (cord conpression)

- cervical spondylotic **radiculopathy** (root compression)

Leading cause of **progressive spastic quadriparesis w/ sensory loss below the neck**.


### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Most with cervical spondylosis have no impairment.

Degeneration of the annulus fibrosus of cervical intervertebral discs Â± osteophytes.

Narrows the spinal canal + intervertebral foramina.

As neck flexes + extends, cord is damaged as it drags over the bony spurs anteriorly + indented by thickened ligamentum flavum posteriorly.

### SIGNS

- limited, painful neck movement

- crepitus

- Lhermitte's symptom: neck flexion --> tingling down spine

- stabbing or dull arm pain (brachialgia)

- forearm/wrist pain 

#### CORD COMPRESSION

- spastic leg weakness: often 1 leg > other

- weak, clumsy hands

- numbness in hands

- 'heavy' legs

- foot drop/poor walking

- incontinence, hesitancy + urgency - often late

#### RADICULOPATHY

- pain/electrical sensations in arms or fingers at level of compression (see table)

- dull reflexes

- dynatomal sensory disturbance: numbness, tingling, decreased pain + 
temp (see table)

- LMN weakness + eventual wasting in muscles innervated by specific root

- loss of position + vibration sense 

Typical motor + sensory deficits from individual root involvement:

Root | Power | Reflex | Sensation
-- | -- | -- | --
C5 (C4/C5 disc) | weak deltoid + supraspinatus | decreased supinator jerks | numb elbow
C6 (C5/C6 disc) | weak biceps + brachioradialis | decreased biceps jerks | numb thumb + index finger
C7 (C6/C7 disc) | weak triceps + finger extension | decreased triceps jerks | numb middle finger
C8 (C7/C8 disc) | weak finger flexors + small muscles of the hand |  | numb 5th + ring finger

Below level of affected root, may see UMN signs suggestive of cord compression (examine the legs):

- spasticity

- weakness

- brisk reflexes

- upgoing plantars

##### DYNATOMES

Dynatome = area of pain or pins + needles caused by trapped nerve root. Don't map to dermatomes or myotomes because of the complex referred pain mechanisms involved.

Nerve root | Area of pain
-- | --
C3/C4 | neck or trapezius 
C5 | shoulder radiating down front of arm to below elbow
C6 | similar to carpal tunnel syndrome but worse in elbow flexors + wrist extensors
C7 | radiates down dorsal arm via elbow + into 3rd finger
C8 | down inferior medial aspect of arm into 4th + 5th digits, often confused w/ ulnar neuropathy


### INVESTIGATIONS

**MRI** to localise lesion.

**Time to walk 30m** helps monitor progress.

### DDx

- multiple sclerosis

- nerve root neurofibroma

- subacute combined degeneration of the cord (B12 deficiency)

- compression by bone or cord tumours

- intramedullary spinal sarcoidosis

### MGMT

Firm neck collar may relieve pain but disliked by pts.

Surgical root decompression: **laminectomy** or **laminoplasty**. Usually halts progression and may improve leg weakness.

Opt for **conservative mgmt** if spinal transverse area is >70mm^2, pt elderly or motor conduction time normal.

**Transforaminal steroid injection** may reduce pain from nerve root inflammation.

#### RARE COMPLICATIONS

- diaphragm paralysis

- spinal artery syndrome mimicking angina, from spinal artery compression
