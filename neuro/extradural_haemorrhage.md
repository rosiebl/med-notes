# EXTRADURAL HAEMORRHAGE

In extradural (or epidural) haemorrhage, blood accumulates between the skull bone and dura mater.

Suspect if, after a head injury, conscious level falls or is slow to improve, or there is a lucid interval.

Often due to:

- fractured temporal or parietal bone

- causing laceration of middle meningeal artery + vein

- typically after trauma to temple just lateral to eye

Any tear in a dural venous sinus will also result in extradural bleed.


### PRESENTATION

**Lucid interval** pattern:

- deteriorating consciousness after any head injury that initially produced no loss of consciousness

- or deterioration after intiial drowsiness post-injury seems resolved

- typical of extradural bleeds

May last hours to days before GCS falls due to increasing intracranial pressure:

- increasingly severe headache

- vomiting

- confusion

- fits

- ± hemiparesis w/ brisk reflexes + upgoing plantar

If bleeding continues:

- ipsilateral pupil dilates

- coma deepens

- bilateral limb weakness 

- breathing deep + irregular: brainstem compression

Death follows period of coma, due to respiratory arrest.

Bradycardia + raised BP are late signs.

#### DDx OF LUCID INTERVAL

- epilepsy

- carotid dissection

- carbon monoxide poisoning

### INVESTIGATIONS

**CT**:

- haematoma

- often biconvex/lens shaped

	- blood forms more rounded shaped than sickle-shaped haematoma

	- tough dura keeps blood more localised

**Skull Xray**: may be normal, or show # lines across course of middle meningeal vessels.

Skull # after trauma should prompt CT.

Lumbar puncture contraindicated.

### MGMT

Stabilise.

Transfer urgently to neurosurgical unit for **clot evacuation ± ligation of bleeding vessel**.

Care of airway + measures to decrease intracranial pressure often require intubation + ventilation (+ mannitol IVI).

### PROGNOSIS

Excellent if dx + operation early.

Poor if coma, pupil abnormalities or decelerate rigidity present pre-op.
