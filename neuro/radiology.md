intracranial - inside skull, extracranial - outside skull, part of system.

extra-axial - external to the brain parenchyma

intra-axial - within the brain parenchyma




extra/epidural space - POTENTIAL space between skull and dura

dura mater - stuck to periosteum. stuck at sutures so cannot be displaced at these points.

subdural - space below dura but above arachnoid.

arachnoid mater - free floating, follows convolutions of brain.

subarachnoid - between arachnoid and pia.

pia mater - on surface of brain, follows convolutions of brain

3,4 midbrain

5,6,7,8 pons

9,10,11,12 medulla

Acute mental status change: first study is always noncontrast head CT.

CTA neck: aortic arch through circle of willis
CTA head; circle of willis only

MRA brain: noncontrast
MRA neck: without and with contrasts

- black: air or fat
- white: bone
- whiter than other soft tissue: blood until proven otherwise. as blood degrades, the colour gets darker (think of in chronic bleeds). pts with coagulation issues or anaemia will also have isodense blood so easy to miss bleeds on their films.

young people - subdural as important as epidural. die from mass effect and compression, herniation, hydrocephalus.

old people - some compensation in subdural because of brain atrophy

'coup-contrecoup' injury across from where blow was because of impact on the inside of the skull on the opposite side to the trauma.
