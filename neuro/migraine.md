# MIGRAINE

Migraine is a chronic, genetically determined, episodic neurological disorder that usually presents in early-to-mid life.

Prevalence 8%, F:M ~2:1.

### SYMPTOMS 

Classically: visual or other aura lasting 15-30min followed within 1h by unilateral, throbbing headache.

Or: 

- isolated aura with no headache

- common migraine:
	- episodic severe headaches w/o aura
	- often premenstrual
	- usually unilateral
	- nausea, vomiting ± photophobia/phonophobia
	
May have allodynia: all stimuli produce pain.

Signs: none.

#### PRODROME

Precedes headache by hours/days.

- yawning
- cravings
- mood/sleep change

#### AURA

Precedes headache by minutes + may persist during it.

Visual:

- chaotic cascading, distorting, melting/jumbling of lines, dots or zigzags
- scotomata
- hemianopia

Somatosensory: parasthesiae spreading from fingers to face.

Motor:

- dysarthria + ataxia: basilar migraine
- ophthalmoplegia
- hemiparesis

Speech:

- 8% of auras
- dysphasia, or
- paraphasia, e.g. phoneme substitution

#### CRITERIA IF NO AURA

>5 headaches lasting 4-72h + nausea/vomiting (or photo/phonophobia), + any 2 of:

- unilateral
- pulsating
- impairs (or worsened by) routine activity

No investigations if typical history.

### ASSOCIATIONS

- obesity: weight loss may decrease excess oestrogen production in adipose tissue but benefit unproven

- patent foramen ovale: some say catheter closure may help

### PARTIAL TRIGGERS

Seen in 50%: CHOCOLATE - 

- chocolate
- hangovers
- orgasms
- cheese
- oral contraceptives
- lie-ins
- alcohol
- tumult
- exercise

### DIFFERENTIAL

- cluster or tension headache
- cervical spondylosis
- hypertension
- intracranial pathology
- sinusitis/otitis media
- caries

TIA may mimic migraine aura.

Migraine rarely a sign of other pathology.

### MGMT

#### PHARMACOLOGICAL

**NSAIDs**:

- e.g. **ketoprofen** 100mg, **aspirin** 900mg/6h
- less chance of developing medication misuse hedache
- similar efficacy to oral 5HT agonists

**Triptans**:

- e.g. **rizatriptan**, **sumatriptan**
- generally better tolerated than ergots
- CI if IHD, coronary spasm, uncontrolled HTN, recent lithium, SSRIs
- rare SE: arrhythmias or angina ± MI

**Ergotamine**: danger of vascular damage, gangrene. Many CI.

12-weekly **botulinum toxin type A** inections are last resort in chronic migraine.

#### NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL

Warm/cold packs to head, rebreathing into paper bag may help abort attacks.

?role for spinal manipulation, riboflavin + magnesium.

### PREVENTION

Remove triggers.

Ensure analgesis rebound headache isn't complicating things.

#### PHARMACOLOGICAL

e.g. if frequency >2/month or not responding to drugs.

1st line:

- **propanolol** 40-120mg/12h 

- **amitriptyline** 10-75mg nocte (SE drowsiness, dry mouth, vision loss)

- **topirimate** 25-50mg/12h (SE memory loss)

- Ca-channel blockers

2nd line:

- **valproate**

- **pizotifen**: effective, but unacceptable weight gain in some

- **gabapentin**

- **pregabalin**

- **ACE-i**

- **NSAIDs**

Less evidence for levetiracetam, tiagabine + lamotrigine.


#### CONSIDERATIONS IN WOMEN

##### CONTRACEPTIVE PILL

Risk of stroke in women with migraines taking the Pill (combined contraception). 

Migraine + aura have higher risk, precluding Pill use. 

Progesterone-only or non-hormonal contraception fine.

If problem is migraine w/o aura in pill-free period, consider alternative contraception, tricycling or oestrogen supplements.

##### PERIMENSTRUAL MIGRAINE

If no CI can give **NSAID** at onset of menses to last day of bleeding.

± **trandermal oestrodiol patches** 3 days before menses, for up to a week.

##### PREGNANCY

Migraine often improves - if not, refer.

Worsening migraine in pregnancy associated with risk of pre-eclampsia + cardiovascular complications.

Prophylaxis:

- stop, or use **amitriptyline** (most other options are teratogenic)

- anti-emetic: **cyclizine** or **promethazine**

- analgesia: **ibuprofen** or **aspirin** up to 30 weeks gestation
