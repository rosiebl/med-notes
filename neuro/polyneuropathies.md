# POLYNEUROPATHIES

**Polyneuropathies** are disorders of peripheral or cranial nerves, whose distribution is usually symmetrical and widespread, often with distal weakness and sensory loss. 

Classified by:

- course
	- acute
	- chronic
- function
	- sensory
	- motor
	- autonomic
	- mixed
- pathology
	- demyelination
	- axonal degeneration
	- both
	
Mostly motor | Mostly sensory
-- | --
Guillain-Barre syndrome | Diabetes mellitus
Lead poisoning | Renal failure
Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome | Leprosy

[For autonomic neuropathy look at other notes]

### CAUSES

For a short list, use the mnemonic:

- **A**lochol
- **B**12
- **C**hronic renal failure
- **D**iabetes and **D**rugs
- **E**very vasculitis
- PLUS Cancer, Lyme disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth


##### Metabolic

- diabetes mellitus

- renal failure

- hypothyroidism

- hypoglycaeima

- mitochondrial disorders

##### Vasculitides

- polyarteritis nodosa

- rheumatoid arthritis

- Wegener's granulomatosis

##### Malignancy

- paraneoplastic syndromes

- polycythaemia rubra vera

##### Inflammatory

- Guillain-Barre syndrome

- Sarcoidosis
	
- CIDP: chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy
	- autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves
	- distal onset of weakness/sensory loss in limbs + nerve enlargement + increased CSF protein


##### Infections

- leprosy

- HIV

- syphilis

- Lyme disease

##### Nutritional

- low vitamin B1, B12, e.g. alcohol abuse

- low vitamin E, folate

- high vitamin B6

##### Inherited syndrome

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth

- Refsum's syndrome

- porphyria

- leucodystrophy

##### Toxins

- lead

- arsenic

##### Drugs

- alochol

- isoniazid

- phenytoin

- vincristine

- cisplatin

- nitrofurantoin

- metronidazole

##### Others

- paraproteinaemias

- amyloidosis

### HISTORY

Important to ask about:

- time course
- precise nature of symptoms
- any preceding/associated events, e.g.
	- D+V in Guillain-Barre syndrome
	- weight loss in cancer
	- arthralgia from a connective tissue disease
- travel
- alcohol and drug use
- sexual infections
- family history

Palapable nerve thickening: think of Charcot-Marie-Tooth or leprosy.

Examine other systems for clues to the cause, e.g. alcoholic liver disease.


### SIGNS & SYMPTOMS

#### SENSORY NEUROPATHY

Affects extremities 1st : 'glove and stocking' distribution.

- numbness

- pins and needles

- feeling funny/burning

- difficulty handling small objects e.g. buttons

- signs of trauma, e.g. finger burns, or joint deformation

Diabetic and alcoholic neuropathies are typically painful.


#### MOTOR NEUROPATHY

Often progressive, may be rapid.

- weak or clumy hands

- difficulty walking - falls, stumbling

- difficulty breathing - decreased vital capacity

Signs:

- LMN lesion
	
	- wasting and weakness most marked in distal muscles of hands + feet (foot/wrist drop)
	
	- reflexes reduced or absent


#### CRANIAL NERVE NEUROPATHY

- speaking difficulty

- swallowing difficulty

- diplopia

### INVESTIGATIONS

Bloods:

- FBC
- ESR
- glucose
- U&E
- LFT
- TSH
- B12
- ANA + ANCA

Electrophoresis

CXR

Urinalysis

Consider LP Â±:

- specific genetic tests for inherited neuropathies
- lead level
- antiganglioside Abs

Nerve conduction studies: help distinguish demyelinating + axonal causes.



### MGMT

**Treat the cause**.

**Physio** + occupational therapy.

**Foot care** in sensory neuropathies to minimise trauma.

**Splint joints** to prevent contracture in prolonged paralysis.

Guillain-Barre + CIDP: **IV immunoglobulin** helps.

Vasculitic causes: **steroids/immunosuppressants** may help.

Neuropathic pain:

- **amitriptyline** or **nortriptyline**
- if fails, **gabapentin** or **pregabalin**
