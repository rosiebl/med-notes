# BELL'S PALSY



Also known as idiopathic facial nerve palsy.

Bell's palsy is **an acute unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy** in pts for whom physical hx + examination are otherwise unremarkable, consisting of deficits affecting **all facial zones** equally that fully evolve **within 72h**.

A clinical dx of exclusion: ~30% of facial nerve palsies have a cause but there are several distinguishing features (see below).

Incidence: 15-40.100,000/y.

F ~ M.

Risk increased in pregnancy x3 + in diabetes x5.

### CAUSES

- Bell's palsy (70%)
- Ramsay Hunt syndrome (VZV)
- Lyme disease
- meningitis e.g. fungal
- TB
- viruses (HIV, polio)

Brainstem lesions: stroke, tumour, MS.

Cerebello-pontine angle:

- acoustic neuroma
- meningioma

Systemic disease:

- diabetes mellitus
- sarcoidosis
- Guillain-Barre (often bilateral)

ENT + other causes:

- orofacial granulomatosis
- parotid tumours
- otitis media/cholesteatoma
- trauma to skull base
- diving
- intracranial hypotension

#### CAUSES OF BILATERAL FACIAL WEAKNESS

- Lyme disease

- Guillain-Barre syndrome

- leukaemia

- sarcoidosis

- EBV

- trauma

- myasthenia gravis

### VIIth NERVE PALSY SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

- unilateral sagging of the mouth: drawn up on the normal side on smiling, causing grimace

- drooling of saliva

- food trapped between gum + cheek

- speech difficulty

- failure of eye closure, may cause:

	- watery or dry eye

	- ectropion (sagging + turning out of lower lid)

	- injury from foreign bodies

	- conjunctivitis

#### FEATURES INDICATING BELL'S PALSY

- abrupt onset, e.g. overnight or after nap

- complete unilateral facial weakness at 24-72h

- ipsilateral numbness or pain around ear

- loss of taste (ageusia)

- hypersensitivity to sounds, i.e. hyperacusis from stapedius palsy

#### FEATURES OF OTHER PAHTOLOGIES

- bilateral symptoms

- UMN signs

- other cranial neuropathies e.g. V or XII - also seen in 8% of Bell's

- limb weakness

- rashes

### INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations are to rule out caues of facial nerve palsy.

**Bloods**:

- ESR
- glucose
- Borrelia Abs in Lyme
- VZV Abs in Ramsay Hunt syndrome

**MRI**: space-occupying lesions, stroke, MS.

CSF for infections (rarely done).

Nerve conduction tests at 2wks predict slow recovery if axon degeneration (don't influence mgmt so rarely done).

### PROGNOSIS

**Incomplete paralysis w/o axonal degeneration**: usually complete recovery in a few weeks.

**Complete paralysis**:

- ~80% full recovery

- ~15% axonal degeneration (~50% in pregnancy): 
	- delays recovery
	- starts after ~3/12
	- may be complicated by aberrant reconnections
	
**Complications** due to aberrant reconnections:

- synkinesis, e.g. eye blinking causes synchronous upturning of mouth

- crocodile tears (gusto-lacrimal reflex): misconnection of parasympathetic fibres when eating stimulates unilateral lacrimation, not salivation

### MGMT

**Prednisolone**: if given within 72h of onset, speeds recovery - 95% full recovery, possibly by reducing axonal oedema + thus damage.

Little data to guide mgmt after 72h but corticosteroids widely used.

**Protect eye**: dark glasses + artificial tears if drying, encourage closure by manually closing eye, tape closed at night.

**Surgery**: may be useful to close eye if is a long term problem. Can also try plastic surgery to help straighten face.

Botulinum toxin can help facial symmetry.
