# SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE

Spontaneous bleeding in the subarachnoid space is often catastrophic.

Incidence: 9/100,000/yr.

Typical age: 35-65.

N.B. Around the brain:

- **skull**
- epidural/extradural space
- **dura mater**
- subdural space
- **arachnoid mater**
- subarachnoid space
- **pia mater** (closely contoured to surface of brain)

### CAUSES

Rupture of saccular (berry) aneurysms: 80%.

Arteriovenous malformations: 15%.

No cause is found in <15%.

#### BERRY ANEURYSMS

A berry aneurysm is a small saccular aneurysm in the brain, usually found at bifurcations of arteries or around the Circle of Willis.

Common sites:

- junction of posterior communicating artery + internal carotid

- junction of anterior communicating artery + anterior cerebral artery

- bifurcation of middle cerebral artery

15% are multiple.

Some hereditary.

Associations:

- polycystic arteries

- coarctation of the aorta

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

#### RISK FACTORS

- smoking

- alcohol misuse

- hypertension

- bleeding disorders

- mycotic aneurysm

- ?post-menopausal loss of oestrogen (F:M ~3:2 if >45y)

Close relatives have 3-5x increased risk of SAH.


### PRESENTATION

#### SYMPTOMS

Symptoms: 

- sudden, devastating, typically occipital headache - usually within seconds

- often followed by:

	- vomiting

	- collapse

	- seizures

	- coma

Coma/drowsiness may last for days.

#### SIGNS

Neck stiffness. 

Kernig's sign: when pt supine with hip flexed to 90 degrees, knee cannot be extended.

Terson's syndrome: retinal, subhyaloid + vitreous bleeds. Has worse prognosis: 5x mortality.

Focal neurology **at presentation** may suggest site of aneurysm or intracerebral haematoma.

Later deficits suggest complications.

#### SENTINEL HEADACHE

SAH pts may have expereinced a sentinel headache earlier, perhaps due to small warning leak from aneurysm (~6%).

Recall bias clouds picture.

Surgery more successful in the least symptomatic so be suspicious of any sudden headache, especially w/ neck or back pain.

### DDx

In primary care only ~25% with thunderclap headache have SAH.

50-60% no cause found.

Remainder have meningitis, migraine, intracerebral bleeds or cortical vein thrombosis. 

### INVESTIGATIONS

**CT**: detects >90% SAH within 1st 48h.

**Lumbar puncture** if CT -ve + no contraindication >12h after headache onset.

CSF in SAH:

- uniformly bloody early on

- xanthohromic (yellow) after several hours

	- due to breakdown products of Hb - bilirubin

	- xanthochromia confirms SAH: shows LP wasn't bloody tap

### MGMT

Refer all proven SAH to neurosurgery immediately.

- re-examine CNS often, repeat CT if deteriorating

- **maintain cerebral perfusion**: hydrate well + aim for SBP >160 (only treat HTN if v severe)

- **nimodipine**: calcium antagonist, reduces vasospasm + consequent morbidity from cerebral ischaemia. 60mg/4h PO for 3wks.

- **endovascular coiling**:
	
	- preferred to surgical clipping where possible
	
	- **catheter/CT angiography** to identify single vs. multiple aneurysms before intervention
	
	- **intracranial stents + balloon remodelling** enable treating wide-necked aneuryms
	
	- **microcatheters** to traverse tortuous vessels


### COMPLICATIONS

**Rebleeding**: 

- commonest cause of **death**
- occurs in 20%
- usually in 1st few days

**Cerebral ischaemia**:

- commonest cause of **morbidity**
- due to vasospasm
- may cause permanent CNS deficit
- surgery not helpful at the time, may be later

**Hydrocephalus**:

- due to blockage of arachnoid granulations
- requires ventricular or lumbar drain

**Hyponatraemia**:

- common
- **do not manage w/ fluid restriction** (see above re: risk of cerebral ischaemia)
- seek expert help

### MORTALITY

Grade | Signs | Mortality %
-- | -- | --
I | none | 0
II | neck stiffness + cranial nerve palsies | 11
III | drowsiness | 37
IV | drowsy + hemiplegia | 71 
V | prolonged come | 100

ALmost all mortality occurs in 1st month.

Of those who survive the 1st month, 90% survive a year or more.
