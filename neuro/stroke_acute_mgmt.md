# ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF STROKE

	ACUTE MGMT OF STROKE
	in the 1st hour
	~
	protect airway
	~
	pulse, BP, ECG
	~
	blood glucose
	~
	?urgent CT/MRI
	~
	thrombolysis (unless haemorrhagic)
	~
	nil by mouth (if risk on swallowing)
	~
	antiplatelet agents: aspirin 300mg (unless haemorrhagic)


**Protect the airway**: avoid hypoxia/aspiration.

**Pulse, BP + ECG**: is it an embolus from AF?

N.B. treating even v high BP may be harmful: even a 20% drop may compromise cerebral perfusion, as autoregulation impaired (unless there is encephalopathy or aortic dissection).

If on **HRT**, stop it.

Aim for 4-11 mmol/L **blood glucose**.

**Urgent CT/MRI** if:

- thrombolysis considered

- cerebellar stroke: cerebellar haematomas may need urgent referral for evacuation

- unusual presentation: e.g. alternative dx likely

- high risk of haemorrhage:

	- low GCS

	- signs of raised intracranial pressure

	- severe headache

	- meningism

	- progressive symptoms

	- known bleeding tendency

	- anticoagulated
	
Otherwise imaging can wait (aim <24h).

Diffusion-weighted MRI most sensitive or acute infarct, but CT helps rule out primary haemorrhage.

**Nil by mouth** only if swallowing attempts may lead to choking.

Keep **hydrated** e.g. IVI, but don't overhydrate as risk of cerebral oedema.

**Antiplatelet agents**: aspirin 300mg once haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded.

### THROMBOLYSIS

Thrombolyse if:

- expert team in place

- **patient seen within ~4.5h of the onset of symptoms**

- no contraindication exists

Refer with **utmost urgency** for consideration of reperfusion with **IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator**.

- tPA: **alteplase**, e.g. 0.9mg/kg over 1h

Reduces death and dependency despite small increase in intracranial haemorrhage - usually small and asymptomatic.

Recent use of antiplatelet agents doesn't seem to increase risk.

Always do **CT** 24h post-lysis to identify bleeds (if +ve register at Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke database).

#### CONTRAINDICATIONS

- major infarct or haemorrhage on CT

- mild/non-disabling deficit

- recent birth, surgery, trauma or artery or vein puncture at uncompressible site

- past CNS bleed

- AVM or aneurysm

- severe liver disease, varices or portal hypertension

- seizures at presentation

- anticoagulants or INR >1.7

- platelets <100x10^9/L

- BP >220/130
