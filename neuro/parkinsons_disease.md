# IDIOPATHIC PARKINSON'S DISEASE

Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, whose caridnal features are reasting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability, as well as some non-motor symptoms.

Typical age at onset: 65y.

Prevalence: 0.6% at 60-64y; 3.5% at 85-89y.

### PRESENTATION

Bradykinesia/hypokinesia + one more of:

- tremor at rest (one side worse)

- postural instability

- Â± muscular rigidity

(See notes on Parkinsonism for more complete description).

#### NON-MOTOR FEATURES

- reduced sense of smell

- constipation

- visual hallucinations

- frequency/urgency

- dribbling of aliva

- depression + dementia

- prosody: poor decoding of emotional content of speech

- poor executive function

- REM sleep disorders

Poor simultaneous motor + cognitive functions can lead to freezing when walking - devastating symptom.

### PATHOLOGY

**Mitochondrial DNA dysfunction** causes **degeneration of dopaminergic neurons** in the **substantia nigra pars compacta** - associated with lewy bodies.

--> decreased striatal dopamine levels.

### MGMT

Multidisciplinary team to boost quality of life.

Assess disabillity + cognition objectively + regularly, e.g. via the unified PD rating scale.

Postural exercises help disability + cognition. Weight lifting also thought to be superior to simple fitness programs.

Respite care is much valued by carers in advanced disease.

#### DRUGS

##### Levodopa

- SE: nausea + vomiting (helped by **domperidone**)

- over time:
	
	- efficacy reduces: need larger + more frequent dosing

	- worsening SE

- long term SEs:

	- dyskinesias

	- painful dystonias

	- response fluctuations e.g. unpredicatable 'off' freezing

	- pronounced end-of-dose reduced response

	- ~50% at 6y 

- non-motor SE:

	- psychosis

	- visual hallucinations


When to start **levodopa** is important decision:

- end-of-dose wearing off/dopamine-induced dyskinesias etc. develops over 5-10y

- so may want to start late

- e.g. >70y, or when PD seriously affects life

##### Dopamine agonists

e.g. **ropinirole**, **pramipexole**

Monotherapy can delay starting L-dopa in early stages of PD + reduce doses of L-dopa as PD progresses.

SEs:

- drowsiness
- nausea
- hallucinations
- complusive behaviour, e.g. gambling, hypersexuality

**Amantadine**: weak DA, used for drug-induced dyskinesias in late PD.

Ergot-derived dopamine agonists: **bromocriptine**, **pergolide**, **cabergoline**. Not favoured - can cause heart valvulopathy + serosal fibrosis.

##### MAO-B inhibitors

e.g. **rasagiline**, **selegiline**.

Alternative to dopamine agonists in early PD.

SEs: postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation.

##### Others

Other options include:

**Apomorphine**: potent dopamine agonist, continuous SC infusion to even out end-of-dose effects/resuce pen for sudden 'off' freezing.

Anticholinergics, e.g. **benzhexol, orphenadrine**, help tremor but cause confusion in elderly.

COMT inhibitors, e.g. **entacapone, tolcapone**, may lessen 'off' time in end-of-dose wearing off. Tolcapone requires LFT monitoring.


#### NEUROPSYCHIATRIC COMPLICATIONS

Common.

e.g. depression, dementia, psychosis.

May reflect disease progression or drug SEs.

Try **SSRIs** for depression.

Distinguish drug-induced psychosis from disease progression:

- drug-induced: consider reducing dopamine agonist doses
- disease progression: try atypical antipsychotics e.g. **quetiapine**, **olanzapine**

#### OTHER RX

**Deep brain stimulation** may help those who are partly dopamine-responsive.

**Surgical ablation** or overactive basal ganglia circuits e.g. subthalamic nuclei.
