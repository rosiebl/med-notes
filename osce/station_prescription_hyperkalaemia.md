You are shadowing an FY2 on a night take. You are called to review Jane Doe, hospital number 9875432, born 6th May 1952. She has been in hospital since the 8th July so the FY2 knows she is suffering from acute kidney injury and that she has previously had anaphylaxis in response to  penicillin. She is on the renal ward 7N. The patient has deteriorated over the course of the evening so the ward sister has done an ECG as per the consultantâ€™s earlier instructions. The ECG shows tall tented T waves and a widened QRS complex. The FY2 diagnoses hyperkalaemia and asks you, for your experience, to write up the prescription for calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose.
