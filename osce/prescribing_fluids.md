# PRESCRIBING FLUIDS

### BODY FLUID COMPARTMENTS

~2/3 body weight is water: total body water (TBW)

- ~2/3 TBW = intracellular fluid

- ~1/3 TBW = extracellular fluid (ECF)

	- ~2/3 ECF = interstitial fluid
	
	- ~1/3 ECF = intravascular fluid

Intravascular fluid:

- 5L of blood in average sized adult (65-70 ml/kg)
	
	- 3L plasma
	
	- 2L red cells


### TYPES OF FLUID

#### CRYSTALLOIDS

- Hartmann's solution
- saline
- 5% glucose: dextrose
- "dextrose saline"

mmol/L | Na+ | K+ | Ca++ | Cl- | Lactate- | Glucose
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --| --
Hartmann's | 131 | 5 | 2 | 111 | 29 | 
0.9% saline | 150 | | | 150 | | 
5% dextrose | | | | | | 50g/L

Dextrose saline has 20% saline + 4% glucose.


#### COLLOIDS

- gelofusin: gelatin suspended in saline
- geloplasma: gelatin in Hartmann's-like solution
- albumin

Fluids containing large molecules designed to stay in plasma + maintain plasma oncotic pressure within the intravascular compartment.

- thus keep fluid intravascular

Useful for replacing blood lost until blood is available?

- effective for replacing lost intravascular fluid
- but:
	- risk of allergy
	- expensive
	- issues with religious beliefs around animal products + vegetarians

#### BLOOD PRODUCTS

- packed red cells
	- full cross-match
	- ABO/rhesus typed
	- O-negative "flying squad" blood
- platelets
- fresh frozen plasma
- cryoprecipitate


#### WHERE FLUIDS GO

**Hartmann's/normal saline**: 

- sodium doesn't cross semi-permeable cell membrane
- fluid does not enter intracellular compartment
- 1/3 remains in **intravascular** compartment
- 2/3 "leak" into **interstitial** fluid

**5% glucose/dextrose**: distributed evenly through **TBW**.

**Colloids**:

- stay in the **intravascular** compartment
- contain suspended large molecules which don't leak from intravascular compartment as easily as cyrstalloids
- act as "plasma expanders"

**Blood products**: stay in the **intravascular** compartment.

### FLUID LOSSES + SHIFTS

#### DEHYDRATION

**Dehydration**: loss of water alone. Comes from total body water (of which 1/3 is extracellular), so there is **loss of intracellular fluid**.

Examples of situations causing dehydration:

- pre-operative bowel prep
- persistent nausea + vomiting or diarrhoea
- fever with increased insensible losses

#### HYPOVOLAEMIA

**Hypovolaemia**: **decrease in extracellular fluid volume**, resulting in decreased tissue perfusion. Can be from salt + water loss, or loss of water alone (dehydration).

"Third spacing": shift of fluid from the intravascular space to a nonfunctional space, i.e. compartments which are not normally perfused with fluids.

Examples of situations causing hypovolaemia:

- haemorrhage
- septicaemic shock
- stress response to surgery

In sepsis, or after manipulation of tissues in surgery, vascular endothelium can become leaky to proteins, so fluid leaks from the intravascular into the the interstitial space, resulting in oedema and hypovolaemia.

Cell membrane ion pumps may also fail, disturbing balance between intracellular and interstitial fluid.

Stress response to surgery: 

- neurohumoral response in direct proportion to the magnitude of the surgery
- leads to catabolic state
- salt + water retention
- potassium loss
- sometimes need extra potassium in IV fluid regime

### PRESCRIBING FLUIDS

#### DEHYDRATION

Mainly depletion of **intracellular** fluid.

	5% dextrose, slow infusions

5% dextrose distributes evenly across TBW so is the best way to deal with dehydration.

In dehydration there is usually hypernatraemia so giving normal saline/Hartmann's would be contraindicated.

#### HYPOVOLAEMIA

Mainly depletion of **intravascular** fluid.

	Hartmann's solution
	0.9% saline
	colloids
	blood/blood products

Crystalloids stay in the extracellular compartment so address depletion of intravascular fluid.

Colloids stay in the intravascular compartment so are probably more effective in dealing with hypovolaemia but are not favoured for the reasons listed above.

NICE do not state whether it is better to use Hartmann's or 0.9% saline.

Hartmann's:

- similar solution to tissue fluid
- so may be favoured in acute settings or anaesthesia
- but increases lactate so risk of lactic acidosis
- ?may be less useful for maintenance as more difficult to calculate solutes given


#### MAINTENANCE

Fluid maintenance regime traditionally described as "2 sweet + 1 salty", but should follow guidelines on maintenance requirement.

Usually use 0.9% saline + 5% dextrose as a base, with potassium added as needed.

	FLUID MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
	
	Water: 25-30 mL/kg/24h
	
	Na+: 1 mmol/kg/24h
	
	Cl-: 1 mmol/kg/24h
	
	K+: 1 mmol/kg/24h
	
	Glucose: 50-100g/24h (for all)
	
Adjust quantities for:

- obese people, based on dieal body weight
- people at risk of fluid overload - give less if:
	- older/frail
	- renal impairment
	- cardiac failure
	- malnourished
	
Adjust fluid prescription for existing deficits of fluid + electrolytes, ongoing losses or abnormal distribution.
