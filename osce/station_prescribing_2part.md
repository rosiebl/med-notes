### PART 1

You are shadowing the med reg in majors in A&E. Jemima Cricket, born 14th December 1990, hospital number 12349876, has come in with shortness of breath and a 2 day history of dry cough. She recently returned from a tech conference in San Diego. She has no known allergies. Based on a chest radiograph and her history, the FY2 suspects Legionella pneumonia and decides to admit Jemima for IV antibiotics. She asks you to write up the antibiotics in the prescription chart: co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and rifampicin.

### PART 2
The FY2 asks you to administer the co-amoxiclav through Jemima’s cannula. However, as you begin give her the drug she becomes uncomfortable and her breathing becomes increasingly harsh. The FY2 recognises anaphylaxis and tells you to stop giving the drug. She quickly administers adrenaline and asks you to change Jemima’s prescription while she continues to manage the situation. She tells you to edit the relevant information and to add adrenaline, chlorphenamine, hydrocortisone and write up a fluid challenge. On auscultation of Jemima’s chest she notices a wheeze, so also requests salbutamol and oxygen.
