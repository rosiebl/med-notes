You are the medical student at a GP practice.

Mrs Brown is a 53 year old asthmatic legal clerk who was recently told at a medical for a new job that she has a high blood pressure of 160/95. She was advised to seek medical attention so she has come to see the GP about what treatment she will need for this. Her BMI is 22.

For your own experience the GP has asked you to talk Mrs Brown through the likely plan of action for her hypertension.

----

*Ideas/concerns/expectations: Mrs Brown is starting a new job and she wants to remain in good health for it - she is worried she may start having symptoms, or perhaps even have a heart attack.*


Pt should be treated because she has Stage 2 hypertension: BP >150/95.

As she is <80yo the target blood pressure is <140/90.

Lifestyle changes:

- low-fat balanced diet 
- reduce salt intake <6g/d 
- exercise
- decrease alcohol intake 
- decrease caffeine intake 
- stop smoking
- sleep at least 6h/night 
- relaxation techniques

*Mrs Brown doesn't smoke or drink much alcohol but she does drink a lot of coffee, and although she has never been overweight she knows she could eat a little less salt.*

Treatment options:

- as Mrs Brown is <55 she should be started on an ACE inhibitor or an ARB
- she has asthma so she is unlikely to tolerate an ACE inhibitor

*If student suggests ACE inhibitor, ask how they work and what are the side effects. Ask if the dry cough will be a problem given her asthma. Student should then suggest an ARB.*

*If student suggests an ARB, ask why that would be the best option. Ask about how they work and what the side effects are.*

*Student may also mention further lines of treatment: calcium channel blocker, thiazide-like diuretic, potassium-sparing diuretic, alpha-blocker + beta-blocker.*

*Student should demonstrate awareness that B-blocker is contraindicated for Mrs Brown as she has asthma.*
