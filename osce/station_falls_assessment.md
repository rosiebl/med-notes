You are a medical student in a GP practice. The GP has asked you to go and talk to a patient, Mrs Jones, who has had a few falls recently, and assess her risk factors.

### Falls assessment

WIPER

Falls hx:

- age
- frequency of falls in past year
- reason for falls e.g. trip, unsteadiness, syncope
- injuries sustained

PMHx/ROS:

- sensory or visual impairment
- musculoskeletal:
	- immobility
	- previous low impact fractures/osteoporosis
	- arthritis
	- myopathy
- neurological:
	- Parkinson's disease
	- strokes
	- neuropathy
	- dizziness
	- confusion/dementia/delirium
	- syncope
- cardiovascular:
	- postural hypotension
	- syncope
	- arrhythmia
	- breathlessness on exertion (aortic stenosis)
- endocrine: diabetes mellitus - peripheral neuropathy, hypoglycaemia, retinopathy
- GI/GU:
	- nutrition
	- incontinence (rushing to toilet)
	- nocturia (walking in the dark)

DHx:

- polypharmacy: >5 is an independent risk factor
- antihypertensives, anti-epileptics, sedatives, psychotropics, laxatives, corticosteroids
- osteoporosis: bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D (reduces # risk if fall)

SHx/environment:

- living situation
	- residence
	- any stairs
	- who they live with
	- carers/home support
- who performs daily task
	- washing, dressing, cooking, cleaning, shopping
- mobility
	- baseline
	- aids - stick/frame
- alcohol use
- footwear - appropriately fitting
- exercise - increase muscle strength reduces frailty + falls risk
- others: rugs, cables, furniture, wet floors, stairs, lighting
