# EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT: COPD

### BTS GUIDELINES

N.B. Inhaled therapy may be delivered via inhaler, spacer or nebuliser.

Good inhaler technique is crucial.

	GENERAL
	
	stop smoking
	encourage exercise
	treat poor nutrition or obesity
	influenza (annual) + pneumococcal vaccination
	pulmonary rehabilitation/palliative care
	NIPPV
	
	~
	1st LINE (FEV1 >80%)
	
	PRN 
	short-acting muscarinic antagonist (ipratropium)
	OR
	short-acting B2 agonist (salbutamol, terbutaline)
	~
	MILD (FEV1 >80%) + MODERATE (FEV1 50-79%)
	
	inhaled long-acting antimuscarinic (tiotropium)
	OR
	inhaled long-acting B2 agonist (salmeterol)
	~
	SEVERE (FEV1 30-49%)
	
	Combination LABA + corticosteroids e.g. Symbicort (budesonide + formoterol)
	OR
	LAMA (tiotropium)
	~
	IF REMAIN SYMPTOMATIC
	
	tiotropium (LAMA) + inhaled steroid + LABA
	consider steroid trial, home nebulisers, oral theophylline
	?mucolytics for productive cough
	~
	PULMONARY HYPERTENSION
	
	assess need for long-term oxygen therapy 
	treat oedema with diuretics

#### STOP SMOKING THERAPY

Stop smoking service in GPs + hospitals, including stop smoking nurses.

Unless contraindicated, offer: 

- nicotine replacement therapy
- varenicline
- bupropion

#### PULMONARY REHABILITATION

Incorporates: 

- physical training
- disease education
- nutritional, psychological and behavioural intervention

For all COPD patients who consider themselves functionally disabled, usually MRC 3+.

### DRUG Rx

#### SHORT-ACTING BRONCHODILATOR INHALERS

- short-acting B2-agonist e.g. **salbutamol**, **terbutaline**

- short-acting muscarinic antagonist e.g. **ipratropium**

SABA inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs, causing the muscles in your airways to relax and open up.

The inhaler should be used when feeling breathless, as a **reliever**.

#### LONG-ACTING BRONCHODILATOR INHALERS

- beta-2 agonist inhalers e.g. **salmeterol**, **formoterol**, indacaterol 

- antimuscarinic inhalers e.g. **tiotropium**, glycopyronium, aclidinium

Work in a similar way to the short-acting inhalers, by relaxing the muscles in your airways, but each dose lasts for at least 12h.

If the short-acting "reliever" inhaler is not controlling your symptoms, you may also use a long-acting one.

#### INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS

Steroid inhalers work by reducing the inflammation in your airways.

If you are still breathless or getting flare ups when using the long-acting bronchodilator inhaler, an inhaled steroid may be added.

Most COPD patients have inhaled steroids as part of a combination inhaler  with a LABA e.g. **Symbicort: formoterol + budesonide**.

#### THEOPHYLLINE

Oral tablet.

Can be used if still symptomatic on all inhalers.

Need blood tests to titrate dose.

Side effects:

- upset stomach/nausea

- increased heart rate, feeling shaky/dizzy

- headache

#### MUCOLYTICS

e.g. **carbocisteine**

Useful for pts with  persistent productive cough, or frequent/bad flare ups.

Thin the mucus/phlegm.

### MANAGEMENT OF COPD EXACERBATION

Patient may be admitted to hospital.

Treat with:

- nebulised bronchodilators

- prednisolone 30mg PO for 7-14 days

- Abx (if there is more purulent sputum than usual)

May consider NIV or intubation.

If pt not responsive to nebulised bronchodilators then can use IV theophylline.
