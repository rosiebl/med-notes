# EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT: HYPERTENSION

### STAGES OF HYPERTENSION

Normotensive = ABPM <135/80mmHg

Stage 1 HTN = ABPM >135/85mmHg

Stage 2 HTN = ABPM >150/95mmHg

### INITIATING TREATMENT AND AIMS

Offer antihypertensive treatment to:

—> people <80yo with Stage 1 HTN and:

- target organ damage
- known CVD
- renal disease
- diabetes
- 10y CVD risk >20%

—> anyone with Stage 2 HTN


In <80yo, aim for BP <140/90.

In >80yo, aim for BP <150/90.

In diabetic, aim for BP <130/80.

### LIFESTYLE

Patients with HTN can change their lifestyle to reduce their BP (modifiable risk factors), e.g.:
	
- low-fat balanced diet

- reduce salt intake <6g/d

- exercise

- decrease alcohol intake

- decrease caffeine intake

- stop smoking

- sleep at least 6h/night

- relaxation techniques


Group work can be helpful with this.
