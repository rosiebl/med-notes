# EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT: ASTHMA

#### BEHAVIOUR

- quit **smoking**

- avoid **precipitants** where possible: allergens, smoking, NSAIDs, B-blockers, cold air, exercise, pollution, infection, work-related triggers

- good **inhaler technique**

- monitor PEF with home peak flow meter

- learn to self-manage in response to PEF/symptoms

- advice for emergencies, including written action plan

- learn relaxed breathing techniques

#### BRITISH THORACIC SOCIETY GUIDELINES

Start at the step most appropriate to severity.

Move up if needed, or down if control good for >3 months.

Rescue courses of prednisolone can be used at any time.

	STEP 1
	
	Occasional short-acting inhaled B2-agonist PRN for symptom relief
	--> e.g. salbutamol
	
	If used >1/day, or night-time symptoms
	~
	STEP 2
	
	Add standard-dose inhaled steroid or start at dose appropriate for severity + titrate
	--> e.g. beclametasone
	~
	STEP 3
	
	Add long-acting-B2 agonist
	--> e.g. salmeterol
	
	If benefit but still inadequate control, continue LABA + increase dose of inhaled steroid
	
	If no effect of LABA, stop. Review dx.
	
	May try leukotriene receptor antagonist (e.g. montelukast) or oral theophylline.
	~
	STEP 4
	Consider trials of the following in conjunction with previous therapy:
	
	--> beclametasone up to 2000 micrograms/day
	--> modified-release oral theophylline
	--> modified release oral B2-agonist
	--> oral leukotriene receptor antagonist e.g. montelukast, zafirlukast
	~
	STEP 5
	Add regular oral prednisolone.
	
	Continue with high-dose inhaled steroids.
	
	Refer to asthma clinic.


N.B. anticholinergics - muscarinic antagonists e.g. **ipratropium** (short-acting) + **tiotropium** (long-acting) - may decrease muscle spasm synergistically with B2-agonists but nor ecommended in current guidelines for **chronic** asthma. May be of more benefit in COPD.

Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody e.g. **omalizumab** may be useful in highly selected pts with persistent allergic asthma. Given as SC injection every 2-4 weeks. Specialists only.

#### ACID REFLUX

40-60% of asthmatics have acid reflux.

Rx improves spirometry, although not necessarily symptoms.

	Antacids (magnesium trisilicate mixture) or alginates (Gaviscon) relieve symptoms.

	PPI (better than H2 blockers). e.g. lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO, omeprazole.
