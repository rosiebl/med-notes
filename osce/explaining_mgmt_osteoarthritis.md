# EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT: OSTEOARTHRITIS

Aim to treat symptoms/disability, not radiological findings.

Depression + poor quad strength are better indicators of pain than radiological severity.


### LIFESTYLE

Likely to have the most impact.

	Weight loss.

	Exercises for strength and stability, hydrotherapy (esp for lower limb OA).

### NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MEASURES


- thermotherapy: local heat/ice packs
- electrotherapy: TENS machine for pain relief
- aids + devices: bracing/joint supports/insoles
- assistive devices: walking aids
- can involve occupational therapy
- manual therapy: manipulation + stretching, especially for the hip


- rubefacients

Acupuncture for knee has some evidence (K&C) but NICE guidelines state should not be offered.


### PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

No proven agent to halt or reverse OA.

NICE guidelines on pain management in OA:

	1st LINE
	Paracetamol and/or topical NSAIDs
	
	adjunct in knee/hand: topical capsaicin
	~
	If 1st line ineffective:
	
	substitute topical NSAID for oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor
	~
	If 1st line insufficient:
	
	add oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor
	~
	Adjunct: intra-articular corticosteroid injection.
	
	~
	Use oral NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitors at lowest dose possible for shortest possible time.
	Co-prescribe with PPI, e.g. lansoprazole, omeprazole.
	Avoid injecting same joint multiple times.

As well as NSAIDs/COX-2 inhibitor can consider opioids, but use w/ caution in elderly pts.


#### DO NOT OFFER

- acupuncture
- glucosamine or chondroitin products
- rubefacients
- intra-articular hyaluronan injections

### SURGERY


For most total hip or knee replacement reduces pain and stiffness, increases function, mobility and independence.

Hip and knee replacement = in safety. Complication rate ~1%.

Other things:

- resurfacing hip surgery: popular, ?higher complications in women
- unicompartmental knee replacement: less major, appropriate for some
- realignment osteotomy of knee or hip
- excision arthroplasty of 1st MTP and base of thumb
- fusion of 1st MTP joint
