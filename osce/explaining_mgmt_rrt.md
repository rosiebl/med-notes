# EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT: RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is therapy which replaces nonendocrine kidney function (blood filtration) and is used in patients with renal failure.

RRT options:

- dialysis
	- haemodialysis
	- haemofiltration
	- peritoneal dialysis
- transplant

Transplantation is the 'best' option but is major surgery + not always successful. Dialysis can maintain stability but has many complications.

**Conservative mgmt** is a reasonable option in pts for whom any for of RRT is unacceptable, e.g. very elderly, significant comorbidities. Focus care on symptom control and delaying progression of disease.

### STARTING DIALYSIS

RRT is considered once patient is in end-stage renal failure, or if they are suffering from serious complications of impaired renal function despite their GFR being outside of the criteria for "ESRF".


### HAEMODIALYSIS

Blood is passed over a semi-permeable membrane against dialysis fluid passing in the opposite direction.

--> Blood is always meeting a less-concentrated solution.

--> Diffusion of small solutes occurs down the concentration gradient.

Larger solutes do not clear as effectively.

Ultrafiltration creates a negative transmembrane pressure and is used to clear excess fluid.

**Sessions are 3 or 4 times per week, and last around 4 hours.**

Some pts may be trained to do at home.

#### PROS

- main advantage: 3 or 4 dialysis-free days per week

- supervised + cared for: good for vulnerable patients who aren't able to self-dialyse as for PD

- separate home and hospital: can be better psychologically

#### CONS

**Lifestyle**:

- time consuming

- need to plan life around sessions

- difficult to travel abroad (although there is international database of 
dialysis units)

- diet and amount of fluid drunk needs to be restricted


**Adverse effects of haemodialysis**:

- disequilibration syndrome: neurological signs/symptoms due to **cerebral oedema**, which occur during or shortly after haemodialysis (also known as disequilibrium syndrome)

- **hypotension**

- **access problems**

	- **AV fistula**
		- thrombosis
		- stenosis
		- steal syndrome: vascular insufficiency due to a fistula
	- **tunnelled venous access line**
		- infection
		- blockage
		- recirculation of blood
		
### PERITONEAL DIALYSIS

Peritoneum used as a semi-permeable membrane.

**Tenckhoff catheter** inserted into the peritoneal cavity and fluid infused, allowing solutes to diffuse slowly across.

Ultrafiltration acheived by adding osmotic agents e.g. lgucose to the fluid.

Simple to perform.

Multiple possble regimens.


#### PROS

- can do at home - no need for bulky equipment

- more freedom to travel - portable equipment

- fewer restrictions on fluid + diet than haemodialysis



#### CONS

**Lifestyle:**

- have to do every day, can be disruptive

- permanent catheter in abdomen - some pts do not like

**Adverse effects of peritoneal dialysis:**

- PD peritonitis

- exit site infection

- loss of membrane function over time due to fibrosis + contracture: can lead to technical failure and need for change of RRT

- loss of protein in dialysis fluid can cause fatigue Â± malnutrition

### COMPLICATIONS

Annual mortality ~20%: most due to cardiovascular disease.

Main complications of dialysis:

- **cardiovascular disease**: MI + CVA much more common in dialysis pts

- **protein-calorie malnutrition**: common, associated with morbidity/mortality

- **renal bone disease**: renal osteodystrophy, osteitis fibrosa

- **infection**: granulocyte dysfunction from uraemia - sepsis mortality 100-300x greater in dialysis pts

- **amyloid**: accumulation can cause carpal tunnel, arthralgia, fractures

- **malignancy**: more common in dialysis pts
