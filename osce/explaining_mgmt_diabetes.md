# EXPLAINING MANAGEMENT: DIABETES MELLITUS

Address all vascular risk factors: they often cluster in pts.

### MONITORING GLUCOSE CONTROL

**Fingerprick glucose**:

- T1DM + T2DM on insulin

**HbA1C (glycated haemoglobin)**: related to mean glucose level over previous 8/52, ie. RBC half-life.

Ask about **hypoglycaemic attacks** - beware hypoglycaemia unawareness.


### GENERAL

- structured education program

- lifestyle advice: diet, exercise, smoking cessation

- start statin e.g. simvastatin 40mg nocte

- BP control

- foot + eye care

- pregnancy care in multidisciplinary clinic

- advise informing driving license authority: loss of hypoglycaemia awareness may lead to loss of licence


### T2DM

Lifestyle advice: diet, exercise, smoking cessation.

Diet: low-carb diets improve glycaemic control.  Low-carb ketogenic diet better than low-GI reduced-calorie diet.

#### GUIDELINES

##### Metformin tolerated

	~1st line~
	
	METFORMIN

if HbA1C >58 mmol/L (7.5%), add gliptin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone or SGLT-2 inhibitor

	~2nd line~
	
	METFORMIN + GLIPTIN
	METFORMIN + SULFONYLUREA
	METFORMIN + PIOGLITAZONE
	METFORMIN + SGLT-2 INHIBITOR

if HbA1C >58 mmol/L (7.5%), move to **insulin** or add sulfonylurea or SGLT-2 inhibitor

	~3rd line~
	
	INSULIN
	or
	METFORMIN + GLIPTIN + SULFONYLUREA
	METFORMIN + SULFONYLUREA + SGLT-2 INHIBITOR
	METFORMIN + PIOGLITAZONE + SULFONYLUREA
	METFORMIN + PIOGLITAZONE + SGLT-2 INHIBITOR

if triple therapy **not effective, not tolerated, or contraindicated**, AND BMI >35

	~4th line~
	
	METFORMIN + SULFONYLUREA GLP-1 + MIMETIC

NB. Oxford handbook gives slightly different cut offs, e.g. add 2nd line rx if HbA1C >53 mmol/L after 16/52 of metformin; add 3rd line rx if HbA1C >57mmol/L after 6/12. 

##### Metformin not tolerated/contraindicated

1st line one of

	~1st line~
	
	GLIPTIN
	SULFONYLUREA
	PIOGLITAZONE

if HbA1C >58 mmol/L (7.5%), add 2nd drug

	~2nd line~
	
	GLIPTIN + SULFONYLUREA
	SULFONYLUREA + PIOGLITAZONE
	PIOGLITAZONE + GLIPTIN
	(any combination)

if HbA1C >58 mmol/L (7.5%), move to insulin 
	~3rd line~
	
	INSULIN



### T1DM & INSULIN-DEPENDENT T2DM

Rx is with **insulin**.

#### INSULIN USE

Educate to self-adjust doses in light of exercise, fingerprick glucose + calorie intake.

Ensure: phone support, can modify diet wisely, partner can abort hypoglaycaemia.


##### Subcutaneous insulins

Short-, medium- or long-acting.

**Ultra-fast acting**: inject at start of meal, or just after. Helps match actual eating rather than planned. e.g. **Humalog**, **Novarapid**.

**Isophane insulin**: variable peak at 4-12h. Favoured by NICE.

**Pre-mixed insulin**: with ultra-fast component. e.g. **Novomix**.

**Long-acting recombinant human insulin analogues**: 

- **insulin glargine** e.g. 0.4U/kg/d at bedtine
hypo issues
- **insulin detemir** e.g. 0.5U/kg/d: similar, role in intensive insulin regimens for overweight T2DM

N.B. Remember illness often increases insulin requirement despite reduced food intake.
