# DIABETIC EMERGENCIES

See notes on hypoglycaemia & DKA.

### HYPERGLYCAEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR NON-KETOTIC COMA

Also known as **hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic syndrome** (HHS).

Characterised by:

- profound hyperglycaemia (glucose >33.3 mmol/L)
- hyperosmolality (effective serum osmolality >320 mmol/kg)
- volume depletion
- in the absence of significant ketoacidosis (pH >7.3 & HCO3 >15mmol/L)

Often discussed as a separate entitiy to DKA but both are on a spectrum of metabolic derangement in diabetes and ~33% of pts present with a mixed picture of DKA and HONK.

Typically T2DM at risk.

Hx longer than DKA e.g. 1wk.

**Occlusive events** are a danger - look for:

- focal CNS signs
- chorea
- DIC
- leg ischaemia/rhabdomyolysis
- DVT

Give LMWH prophylaxis to all unless contraindicated.

**Management**:

- rehydrate slowly with 0.9% saline IVI over 48h

- replace K when urine starts to flow

- only use insulin if blood glucose no falling by 5mmol/L/h with rehydration, OR if ketonaemia

- keep BM at least 10-15mmol/L for first 24h to avoid cerebral oedema

- look for cause e.g. MI, drugs, bowel infarct


### LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Rare but serious complication of DM with **metformin use** or **septicaemia**.

Blood lactate >5mmol/L

Treat sepsis vigorously, maintain blood pressure and hence tissue perfusion.

Stop metformin.
