# PRE-DIABETIC STATES

Before progressing to T2DM, patients may have a phase of 'pre-diabetes', in which they have some degree of insulin resistance. This is a crucial opportunity to prevent the progression of disease with lifestyle intervention.

###  METABOLIC SYNDROME

Metabolic syndrome = central obesity (BMI >30 or high waist circumference ~>90-94m, 80f) AND 2 of:

- BP >130/85
- triglycerides >1.7 mmol/L, HDL <1.03f/1.29m mmol/L
- diabetes mellitus

20% affected.

Aetiology: weight, genetics + insulin resistance all important.

#### POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES

- vascular events e.g MI (may not increase risk beyond individual risk factors)
- DM
- neurodegeneration
- microalbuminaemia
- gallstones
- cancers e.g. pancreas
- fertility problems

#### MGMT

- exercise
- weight loss ± Mediterranean (?ketogenic) diet
- antihypertensives
- hypoglycaemics e.g. metformin ± glitazones
- statins

###  INSULIN RESISTANCE

Risk factors:

- metabolic syndrome
- obesity
- Asian people (lower threshold for dx obesity, BMI >23)
- TB drugs
- SSRIs
- pregnancy
- acromegaly
- Cushing's
- renal failure
- CF
- polycystic ovary
- Werner's syndrome

Causes:

- obesity
	- ?increased rate of release of non-esterified fatty acids causing post-receptor defects in insulin action
- genetics
	- mutations in genes encoding insulin receptors
- circulating autoantibodies
	- Abs to extracellular domain of insulin receptor



### IGT

Impaired glucose tolerance: 

- fasting plasma glucose <7 mmol/L AND
- OGTT 2h glucose >7.8 mmol/L BUT <11.1 mmol/L

### IFG

Impaired fasting glucose: fasting plasma glucose >6.1 mmol/L BUT <7 mmol/L.

Do OGTT to exclude DM.

?lower risk of progression to DM in IFG cf. IGT.

Manage both with lifestlye intervention + annual review.
