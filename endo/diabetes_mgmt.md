# MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS

Address all vascular risk factors: they often cluster in pts.

### MONITORING GLUCOSE CONTROL

**Fingerprick glucose**:

- T1DM + T2DM on insulin

**HbA1C (glycated haemoglobin)**:

- related to mean glucose level over previous 8/52, ie. RBC half-life
- any improvement helps: complications rise with rising HbA1C
- negotiable targets, e.g. 48-57mmol/L
- if at risk from effects of hypoglycaemia consider less tight control

Ask about hypoglycaemic attacks - beware hypoglycaemia unawareness:

- loss of awareness of low blood sugar
- happens if control is too tight or in T1DM due to decreased glucagon secretion
- may not have any symptoms until hypoglycaemia is severe (seizures, loss of consciousness)
- may regain awareness if control loosened.

### GENERAL

- structured education program

- lifestyle advice: diet, exercise, smoking cessation

- start statin e.g. simvastatin 40mg nocte

- BP control

- foot care

- pregnancy care in multidisciplinary clinic

- advise informing driving license authority: loss of hypoglycaemia awareness may lead to loss of licence


### T1DM

Rx is with **insulin**.

#### INSULIN USE

Educate to self-adjust doses in light of exercise, fingerprick glucose + calorie intake.

Ensure:

- phone support from trained nurse
- dose titration to target, e.g. by 2-4U steps
- can modify diet wisely + avoid binge drinking as danger of delayed hypoglycaemia
- partner can abort hypoglycaemia: sugary drinks, GlucoGel PO if come (no risk of aspiration)

Fingerprick glucose before meals tells you about long-acting dose; after meals tells you about short-acting dose.


##### Subcutaneous insulins

Short-, medium- or long-acting.

**Ultra-fast acting**: inject at start of meal, or just after. Helps match actual eating rather than planned. e.g. **Humalog**, **Novarapid**.

**Isophane insulin**: variable peak at 4-12h. Favoured by NICE.

**Pre-mixed insulin**: with ultra-fast component. e.g. **Novomix**.

**Long-acting recombinant human insulin analogues**: 

- **insulin glargine** e.g. 0.4U/kg/d
- used at bedtime in T1DM or T2DM
- no awkward paek - good if nocturnal hypo issues
- caution if considering pregnancy
- **insulin detemir** e.g. 0.5U/kg/d: similar, role in intensive insulin regimens for overweight T2DM


##### Common insulin regimens

Disposable pens: 

- dial dose
- insert SC at 90 degrees to skin
- vary injection site - outer thigh/abdo
- change needle daily

BD biphasic regimen

- twice daily premixed insulins by pen
- useful in T2DM or T1DM with regular lifestyle

QDS regimen

- before meals ultrafast insulin + bedtime long-acting analogue
- useful for T1DM flexible lifestyle

OD before-bed long-acting insulin: good initial regimen when switching from PO in T2DM.


##### SC insulin during intercurrent illness

Illness often increases insulin requirement despite reduced food intake.

Maintain calorie intake e.g. with milk.

Check BM >4/d. Look for ketonuria.

Admit if vomiting, dehydrated, ketotic, child, pregnant.

### T2DM

Lifestyle advice: diet, exercise, smoking cessation.

Diet: low-carb diets improve glycaemic control.  Low-carb ketogenic diet better than low-GI reduced-calorie diet.

#### DRUGS USED IN DM

Drug class | Mechanism | Route | Main SE | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
**Insulin** | Direct replacement for endogenous insulin | SC | hypoglycaemia, weight gain, lipodystrophy | All T1DM; some T2DM. Classified by source and duration of action.
**Metformin** | Increases insulin sensitivity; decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis. | PO | GI upset, lactic acidosis | 1st line in mgmt of T2DM. Can't use in pts with eGFR <30ml/min. Biguanide.
**Sulfonylureas** | Stimulate pancreatic B cells to secrete insulin | PO | hypoglycaemia, **weight gain**, hyponatraemia |e.g. **gliclazide**, glimepiride
**Thiazolidinediones** | Activate PPAR-gamma receptor in adipocytes to promote adipogenesis + fatty acid uptake | PO | weight gain, fluid retention, hypoglycaemia, fractures, high LFTs | **pioglitazone** (only available). Contraindications: past/present CCF, osteoporosis, stop if weight gain or oedema
DPP-4 inhibitors (-**gliptins**) | increases incretin levels which inhibits glucagon secretion | PO | generally well-tolerated, increased ris of pancreatitis | e.g. **sitagliptin**, **vilagliptin**
SGLT-2 inhibitors (-**gliflozins**) | Inhibits reabsorption of glucose in the kidney | PO | UTI | e.g. **dapagliflozin**, other -gliflozins
GLP-1 agonists (-**tides**) | incretin mimetic which inhibits glucagon secretion | SC | nausea + vomiting, pancreatitis | typically result in weight loss, e.g. **exanatide**
**Sulfonylurea receptor binders** | increase B cell insulin release | PO | - | target post-prandial hyperglycaemia, useful if irregular mealtimes + poor glucose control. e.g. **nateglinide**, **repaglinide**
**Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors** | decrease breakdown of starch to sugar | PO chewed before meal | wind, abdo distension/pain, diarrhoea | e.g. **acarbose**. Add-on drug. 

#### GUIDELINES

##### Metformin tolerated

	~1st line~
	
	METFORMIN

if HbA1C >58 mmol/L (7.5%), add gliptin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone or SGLT-2 inhibitor

	~2nd line~
	
	METFORMIN + GLIPTIN
	METFORMIN + SULFONYLUREA
	METFORMIN + PIOGLITAZONE
	METFORMIN + SGLT-2 INHIBITOR

if HbA1C >58 mmol/L (7.5%), move to insulin or add sulfonylurea or SGLT-2 inhibitor

	~3rd line~
	
	INSULIN
	or
	METFORMIN + GLIPTIN + SULFONYLUREA
	METFORMIN + SULFONYLUREA + SGLT-2 INHIBITOR

	METFORMIN + PIOGLITAZONE + SGLT-2 INHIBITOR

if triple therapy **not effective, not tolerated, or contraindicated**, AND BMI >35

	~4th line~
	
	METFORMIN + SULFONYLUREA GLP-1 + MIMETIC

NB. Oxford handbook gives slightly different cut offs, e.g. add 2nd line rx if HbA1C >53 mmol/L after 16/52 of metformin; add 3rd line rx if HbA1C >57mmol/L after 6/12. 

##### Metformin not tolerated/contraindicated
