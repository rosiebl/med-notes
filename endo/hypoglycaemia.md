# HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Hypoglycaemia = plasma glucose <3mmol/L. Threshold for symptoms varies.

Commonest endocrine emergency. Brain damage/deeath may occur if severe or prolonged.

### SYMPTOMS



### FASTING HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Whipple's triad:

1. symptoms associated with fasting or exercise
2. recorded hypoglycaemia with symptoms
3. symptoms relieved with glucose

#### CAUSES

Usually insulin or sulfonylurea treatment in a known diabetic, e.g. with increased activity, missed meal, accidental or non-accidental overdose.

In non-diabetic adults (EXPLAIN):

- Exogenous drugs, e.g. 
	- insulin
	- oral hypoglycaemics
	- alcohol
	- aspirin poisoning
	- ACEi
	- B-blockers
	- pentamidine
	- quinine sulfate
	- aminoglutethamide
	- insulin-like growth factor

- Pituitary insufficiency

- Liver failure, + some rare inherited enzyme defects

- Addison's disease

- Islet cell tumours (insulinoma) 

- Immune hypoglycaemia e.g. anti-insulin receptor antibodies in 
Hodgkin's disease

- Non-pancreatic neoplasms e.g. fibrosarcomas, haemangiopericytomas

#### INVESTIGATION RESULTS

Hyperglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia:

- insulinoma
- sulfonylureas
- insulin injection - no detectable C-peptide
- non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome
- mutation in insulin receptor gene
- congenital: mutations in genes involved in insulin secretion

Insulin low or undetectable, no excess ketones:

- non-pancreatic neoplasm
- anti-insulin receptor antibodies

Low insulin, high ketones:

- alcohol
- pituitary insufficiency
- Addison's disease

### POST-PRANDIAL HYPOGLYCAEMIA

May occur after gastric/bariatric surgery: 'dumping'.

Investigate with OGTT.

### MGMT OF HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Treat with oral sugar + a long-acting starch e.g. toast.

If episodes are frequent, advise many small high-starch meals.

If post-prandial glucose is low, give slowly absorbed carbohydrate (high fibre).

If diabetic, rationalise insulin rx.

### MGMT OF HYPOGLYCAEMIC COMA

	20-30g glucose IV
	
	e.g. 200-300mL 10% dextrose
	
	Once conscious, give sugary drinks + a meal

[Better to give 10% dextrose in gerater volume than 50% in small vol bc it harms veins.]

Expect prompt recovery.

Glucagon 1mg IV/IM nearly as rapid but won't work in drunk pts.

Dextrose IVI may be needed for severe prolonged hypoglycaemia.
