# HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Hypoglycaemia = plasma glucose <3mmol/L. Threshold for symptoms varies.

Commonest endocrine emergency. Brain damage/deeath may occur if severe or prolonged.


### MGMT OF HYPOGLYCAEMIC COMA

	20-30g glucose IV
	
	e.g. 200-300mL 10% dextrose
	
	Once conscious, give sugary drinks + a meal

[Better to give 10% dextrose in gerater volume than 50% in small vol bc it harms veins.]

Expect prompt recovery.

Glucagon 1mg IV/IM nearly as rapid but won't work in drunk pts.

Dextrose IVI may be needed for severe prolonged hypoglycaemia.
