# DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS

DKA is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes characterised by absolute insulin deficiency, which is potentially fatal. It is the most common acute hyperglycaemic complication of DM.

### MECHANISM

Ketoacidosis is an alternative metabolic pathway to the normal metabolisation of carbohydrates. It's usually used in starvation states, is far less efficient, and produces acetone as a by product.

In acute DKA, (unlike in starvation), there is excess glucose. However, lack of insulin means it can't be taken up by cells to be metabolised, so the body is in a starvation-like state.

Therefore ketoacidosis is the only mechanism of energy production.

	--> severe acidosis + hyperglycaemia

### PRESENTATION

Usually T1DM - v rare in T2DM.

- **gradual drowsiness**

- **vomiting**

- **dehydration**

- abdo pain

- polyuria

- polydipsia

- lethargy

- anorexia

- ketotic breath

- coma

- deep breathing: sighing 'Kussmaul' hyperventilation

#### TRIGGERS

- infection e.g. UTI
- surgery
- MI
- pancreatitis
- chemotherapy
- antipsychotics
- wrong insulin dose/non-compliance

### DX

1. Acidaemia: pH <7.3
2. Hyperglycaemia
3. Ketonaemia

Investigations:

- ECG
- CXR
- urine dip + MSU
- bloods
	- capillary and lab glucose
	- ketones
	- U&E
	- HCO3-
	- amylase
	- osmolality
	- ABG/VBG
	- FBC
	- blood culture


#### SEVERE DKA

If one or more of these is present on admission, consider HDU/ICU transfer for moitoring + central venous access:

- blood ketones >6mmol/L
- venous bicarbonate <5mmol/L
- venous/arterial pH <7.1
- K <3.5mmol/L on admission
- GCS <12
- O2 sats <92% on air
- systolic BP <90mmHg
- Pulse >100 or <60
- anion gap >16

### MGMT

See algorithm in Handbook.

Basically:

	ABC approach, ?fluid bolus
	~
	Investigations
	~
	Insulin: IVI 0.1U/kg/h
	~
	VBGs at 1h, 2h and 2hrly after that
	~
	Assess need for K replacement
	~
	Consider catheter if not apssing urine by 1h
	Consider NG tube if vomiting or drowsy
	Start LMWH
	~
	Avoid hypoglycaemia: when glucose <14mmol/L start 10% glucose to run alongside saline
	~
	Continue fixed-rate insulin until ketones <0.3mmol/L, venous pH >7.3, venous bicarb >18mmol/L
	~
	Find cause/treat infection
	



### PITFALLS

**Plasma glucose** not always high, e.g. if insulin continued.

**High WCC** in absence of infection.

**Infection**: often no fever so investigate anyway. Start abx early if suspected.

**Creatinine**: plasma creatinine measurement may not reflect true renal function due to assays cross-reacting with ketones.

**Hyponatraemia**: common - osmolar compensation for hyperglycaemia. High or normal Na - severe water loss.

**Ketonuria /= ketoacidosis**b. Not all ketones due to diabetes.

**Recurrent ketoacidosis**: BM may be normal before ketones removed from blood so if reduce insulin administered too rapidly may lead to return to DKA.

**Acidosis** w/o high BM may occur - consider OD + lactic acidosis.

**Serum amylase**: often raised, + non-specific abdo pain common, even w/o pancreatitis.

### COMPLICATIONS

- cerebral oedema (get help if sudden CNS decline)

- aspiration pneumonia

- hypokalaemia

- hypomagnesaemia

- hypophosphataemia

- thromboembolism
