# DIABETES MELLITUS

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic syndrome of impaired carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism due to insufficient secretion of insulin or target-tissue resistance to insulin.

It can be described as a vascular disease because the major sequelae are **macrovascular** (cardiovascular, stroke, limb ischaemia, renovascular disase) and **microvascular** (retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy).

### DIAGNOSIS

Dx is based on symptoms and blood glucose levels.

Symptoms of hyperglycaemia:

- polyuria
- polydipsia
- unexplained weight loss
- visual blurring
- genital thrush
- lethargy

WHO criteria:

	symptoms of hyperglycaemia AND raised venous glucose detected once (fasting >7 or random >11.1)
	
	OR
	
	raised venous glucose on 2 separate occasions: fasting >7, random >11.1 or OGTT 2h >11.1
	
HbA1C >48 (6.5%) is somewhat diagnostic, but below doesn't exclude DM. (Avoid in pregnancy, children, and T1DM).

[OGTT = oral glucose tolerance test]

### CATEGORIES 

#### T1DM

Onset: usually adolescent, can be any age.

**Cause**: insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic B-cells.

Associations: other AI conditions. >90% cary HLA DR3 ± DR4. 

Genetics: 

- concordance ~30% in identical twins - environmental influence
- 4 important genes
- 6q determines islet sensitivity to damage e.g. by viruses

Pts prone to **ketoacidosis** and **weight loss**.

**Management**: pts must have insulin.


#### T2DM

Onset: usually over 40, but now see in teens.

Epidemiology: higher prevalence in Asian people, men and elderly people (up to 18%).

**Cause**: decreased insulin secretion ± insulin resistance.

Associations: obesity, lack of exercise, calorie and alcohol excess.

Genetics: 80% concordance in identical twins - indicates stronger genetic influence than T1DM.

Usually progresses from prediabetic phase of impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.

Management: metformin, sulfonylureas, may progress to insulin as well as other pharmacological measures.

#### T1DM VS. T2DM

type | T1DM | T2DM
--- | --- | ---
epidemiology | often pre-puberty | usually older pts
genetics | HLA D3 + D4 linked | no HLA association
cause | autoimmune B cell destruction | insulin resistance/B cell dysfunction
presentation | polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, ketosis | asymptomatic/complications e.g. MI

#### LADA/MODY

**Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)**: form of T1DM with slower pregression to insulin dependence later in life. 

- Think of LADA in adults with new-onset DM who are ketotic ± poor response to oral hypoglycaemica, + slim pts with family/personal hx of AI.

**Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)**: rare autosomal dominant form of T2DM affecting young people with a +ve family hx. 



#### OTHER CAUSES

Drugs:

- steroids
- anti-HIV drugs
- newer antipsychotics
- thiazides

Pancreatic:

- pancreatitis
- surgery where >90% pancreas removed
- trauma
- pancreatic destruction e.g. haemochromatosis, CF
- pancreatic cancer

Endocrine:

- Cushing's disease
- acromegaly
- phaeochromocytoma
- hyperthyroidism
- pregnancy

Others:

- congenital lipodystrophy
- glycogen storage diseases
