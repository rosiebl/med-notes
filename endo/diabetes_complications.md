# COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES

Complications are macrovascular and microvascular. 

**Macrovascular**:

- cardiovascular
- stroke
- limb ischaemia
- renovascular disase

**Microvascular**:

- retinopathy
- nephropathy
- neuropathy (+ diabetic feet)

Vascular risk should be reduced wherever possible. 

**The most important intervention in long-term care of DM is control of BP.**

- target <140/80
- target in pts with end-organ disease <130/80

Try to stop smoking.

Check plasma lipids; start a statin.


### VASCULAR DISEASE

Chief cause of death.

**MI**: 4x more common in DM, more likely to be silent.

**Stroke**: 2x more common.

Women at high risk - DM removes vascular advantage of being female.

- address other risk factors

- suggest **statin for all** e.g. simvastatin 40mg nocte

- **fibrates** useful for high triglycrides/low HDL

- **aspirin** 75mg reduces vascular events (if past stroke/MI) - good as statin co-rx

### NEPHROPATHY

[See renal notes on diabtic nephropathy for more detail].

Kidney is a chief target for end-organ damage.

T1DM nephropathy:

- rare in 1st 5y
- rise in incidence after 10y
- peak in incidence at 15y, then falls
- those who haven't developed nephropathy at 35y are unlikely to do so

T2DM nephropathy:

- ~10% have nephropathy at dx
- up to 50% develop ti over the next 20y
- 20% T2DM develop end-stage renal failure

Screen annually for microalbuminuria.

#### MICROALBUMINURIA

**Microalbuminuria**: urine dipstick -ve for protein but urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) is >3mg/mmol (2.5 men; 3.5 women). 

Gives early warning of impending **renal** disease + is a strong independent risk factor for **cardiovascular** disease.

- if UACR >3, **ACE inhibitor** or **ARB** protects the kidneys
	- inhibits renin-angiotensin system 
	- reduces intra-glomerular pressure and hence proteinuria
	- give even if BP normal
	- ACEi usually 1st line; ARB if intolerant
	- SE:
		- U&Es incerase - monitor K and creatinine periodically
		- cough with ACEi
	
- target BP lower in DM pts with microalbuminuria/proteinuria

- **spironolactone** may help

- refer if UACR >7 ± GFR falling by >5ml/min/1.73m^2/yr

Can be reversible with tight glycaemic + BP control + CV risk mgmt.


### RETINOPATHY

Annual retinal screening mandatory for all pts not already under ophthalmology care.

Refer to ophthalmologist if: pre-proliferative changes OR any uncertainty at/near macula.

Stages:

1. Background retinopathy
2. Pre-proliferative retinopathy
3. Proliferative retinopathy
4. Maculopathy

**Background retinopathy**:

- microaneurysms - dots
- haemorrhages - blots
- hard exudates - lipid deposits
- **refer if near macula**, e.g. for intravitreal triamcinolone

**Pre-proliferative retinopathy**:

- cotton wool spots, e.g. infarcts
- haemorrhages
- venous beading
- signs of retinal ischaemia
- **refer to specialist**


**Proliferative retinopathy**:

- new vessels form
- **urgent referral** 

**Maculopathy**:

- hard to see in early stages
- suspect if acuity decreases
- prompt **laser**, **intravitreal steroids** or **anti-angiogenic agents** may be needed in macular oedema

Pathogenesis: capillary endothelial change --> vascular leak --> microaneurysms --> capillary occlusion --> local hypoxia + ischaemia --> new vessel formation.

High retinal blood flow (due to hyperglycaemia/high BP/pregnancy) triggers this. Causes capillary pericyte damage.

Microvascular occlusion --> cotton wool spots ± blot haemorrhages at interfaces with perfused retina.

New vessels form on disc or at ischaemic areas. Proliferate, bleed, fibrose --> can detach retina.

#### OTHER EYE DISEASE

Cataracts: 

- juvenile 'snowflake' form or senile
- occur earlier in DM pts
- osmotic changes in the lens induced in acute hyperglycaemia reverse with normoglycaemia

Rubeosis iridis: new vessels on iris. Occurs late, may lead to glaucoma.


### NEUROPATHY

#### SYMMETRIC SENSORY POLYNEUROPATHY

'Glvoe and stocking' numbness, tingling + pain.

Can be worse at night.

Rx (in order):

- paracetamol
- tricyclic e.g. amitriptyline
- duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin
- opiates

Helps to avoid weight-bearing.


#### MONONEURITIS MULTIPLEX

e.g. III & VI cranial nerves.

Rx: difficult. If sudden/severe, immunosuppression may help.

#### AMYOTROPHY

Painful wasting of quadriceps + other pelvifemoral muscles.

Use electrophysiology to demonstrate e.g. lumbrosacral radiculopathy, plexopathy, or proximal crural neuropathy.

Natural course: variable with gradual but often incomplete improvement.

Can use IV immunoglobulins.

#### AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY

- postural BP drop
	- may respond to **fludrocortisone** or **midodrine**
- decreased cerebral autoregulation
- loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (vagal neuropathy)
- gastroparesis
	- early satiety
	- post-prandial bloating
	- N+V
	- dx gastric scintigraphy w technetium-labelled meal
	- may respond to **anti-emetics**, **erythromycin** or **gastric pacing**
- urine retention
- erectile dysfunction
- gustatory sweating
- diarrhoea
	- may respond to **codeine phosphate** 



### DIABETIC FEET

Distinguish neuropathy + ischaemia.

#### NEUROPATHY

- injury or infection over pressure points, e.g. metatarsal heads

- sensation loss in stocking distribution

- absent ankle jerks

- neuropathic deformity
	- pes cavus
	- claw toes
	- loss of transverse arch
	- rocker-bottom sole
	
Sensoy loss patchy so examine all areas with monofilament.

#### ISCHAEMIA

- critical toes ± absent dorsalis pedis pulses

Use Doppler to measure pulses if can't feel.

#### ULCERATION

Typically painless, punched-out ulcer in an area of thick callus, ± superadded infection.

Causes cellulitis, abscess ± osteomyelitis.

Assess degree of:

1. neuropathy (clinically)
2. ischaemia (clinically + Doppler ± angiography)
3. bony deformity e.g. Charcot joint (clinically + Xray)
4. infection (swabs, blood culture, xray for osteomyelitis, probe ulcer to reveal depth)

##### PREVENTION

Educate: daily inspection, good shoes.

Regular chiropody to remove callus - haemorrhage + tissue necrosis can occur below.

Treat fungal infections.

Surgery, e.g. angioplasty balloons, stents, subintimal recanalisation, has a role.

##### MGMT

Relieve high-pressure areas with bed rest ± therapeutic shoes.

May need metatarsal head surgery.

Cellulitis: 

- admit for IV abx
- common organisms: staphs, streps, anaerobes
- start with benzylpenicillin ± flucloxacillin ± metronidazole
- IV insulin may improve healing

**Absolute indications for surgery**:

- abscess/deep infection
- spreading anaerobic infeciton
- gangrene/rest pain
- supparative arthritis
