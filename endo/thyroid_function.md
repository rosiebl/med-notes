# THYROID FUNCTION

### NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY

- **hypothalamus** secretes **thyrotropin-releasing hormone** (TRH, tripeptide)

- TRH stimulates production of **thyroid-stimulating hormone** from the **anterior pituitary** (TSH/thyrotropin, glycoprotein)

- TSH increases production and release of **thyroxine** (T4) and **triiodothryonine** (T3) from the **thyroid**

- most T3 formed from peripheral conversion T4 --> T3

- most T3 and T4 in plasma is protein-bound e.g. to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)

T3 + T4 increase cell metabolism via nuclear receptors so are vital for growth + mental development. 

Also increase catecholamine effects.

Problems usually due to problems in thyroid gland itself rather than due to the hypothalamus or anterior pituitary.
