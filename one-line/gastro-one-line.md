# GASTROENTEROLOGY

**Alcoholic liver disease**: three stages of disease caused by chronic heavy alcohol ingestion. Fatty liver (steathosis), alcoholic heptatis (inflammation and necrosis), alcoholic liver cirrhosis.

**Anal conditions**

- **anorectal abscess**: infection of the soft tissues around the anus, usually presenting as severe perianal pain and swelling, sometimes with fever, chills, urinary retention and rarely sepsis.  
- **haemorrhoids**: normal anatomical structures in the anal canal called haemorrhoidal cushions which may enlarge and protrude outside the anal canal causing symptoms.
- **fistula**: small channel which develops between the end of the bowel and the skin around the anus. May be simple or complex, and low or high depending on proximity to the anal sphincter. Usually develops after an anal abscess, or can be caused by IBD, diverticulitis. Also more common in HIV+ people.
- **fissure**: split in the skin of the distal anal canal, characterised by pain on defecation and rectal bleeding. Pain can be severe and condition is common.

Cancers

- stomach
- oesophagus

**Diverticular disease**: a diverticulum is an abnormal sac/pouch formed at a weak point of the digestive tract. Colonic diverticulosis is herniation of mucosa and submucosa  through the muscular layer of the colonic wall. Diverticular disease is a clinical state caused by symptoms from colonic diverticula. Wide spectrum of disease from asymptomatic to severe and complicated disease. Complications - diverticulitis, segmental colitis, lower GI bleeding, infection, abscess, perforation, peritonitis, fistula formation.

**Enteropathies**: a disease of the intestine, especially the small intestine.

**Malabsorption**: imperfect absorption of nutrients int eh GI tract.

**Functional disorders of the GI tract**: abnormal functioning of the GI tract, not caused by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Most common is irritable bowel syndrome. 3 primary features are motility, sensation and brain-gut dysfunction.

**Gallstone disease**: symptoms or complications resulting from the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus or beyond, into the oral cavity (including larynx) or lung. Typical symptoms are heartburn and acid regurg.
