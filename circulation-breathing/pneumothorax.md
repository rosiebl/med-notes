# PNEUMOTHORAX

Pneumothorax occurs when air gains access to, and accumulates in, the pleural space.

For tension pneumothorax, see notes.

### CAUSES

**Spontaneous**:

- especially in young thin men
- due to rupture of subpleural bulla

**Chronic lung disease**:

- asthma
- COPD
- cystic fibrosis
- lung fibrosis
- sarcoidosis

**Infection**:

- TB
- pneumonia
- lung abscess

**Traumatic**:

- including iatrogenic e.g. CVP line insertion, pleural aspiration or biopsy, percutaneous liver biopsy, positive pressure ventilation

**Carcinoma**

**Connective tissue disorders**:

- Marfan's syndrome
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

### CLINICAL FEATURES

**Sudden onset dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain**.

May be asymptomatic e.g. in young fit people with small pneumothoraces.

Pts with asthma/COPD may present with sudden deterioration.

Mechanically ventilated pts can suddenly develop hypoxia or increase ventilation pressures.

**Signs**:

- reduced expansion
- hyper-resonance on percussion
- diminished breath sounds on affected side

### INVESTIGATIONS

Do not do a CXR if suspect tension pneumothorax.

Otherwise: **expiratory CXR**. Look for:

- area devoid of lung markings, peripheral to edge of collapsed lung
- ensure suspected pneumothorax is not a large emphysematous bulla.

**ABG** in dyspnoeic/hypoxic pts + pts with chronic lung disease.


### MGMT

Dependent on primary vs secondary pneumothorax, size + symptoms.

Pneumothorax due to trauma or mechanical ventilation requires **chest drain**.

Get **surgical advice** if:

- bilateral pneumothoraces
- lung fails to expand after intercostal drain insertion
- 2+ previous pneumothoraces on same side
- hx of pneumothorax on opposite side

#### PRIMARY PNEUMOTHORAX

	If pt SOB and/or has a rim of air >2cm on CXR: aspirate.
	~
	If aspiration unsuccessful, consider repeat aspiration.
	~
	If repeat aspiration is unsuccessful, place a chest drain.

#### SECONDARY PNEUMOTHORAX

Secondary pneumothorax = pneumothorax in pt with chronic lung disease.

	If pt SOB and age >50 and rim of air >2cm on CXR: chest drain.
	~
	If pt is not: aspirate + admit for 24h.
	~
	If aspiration fails: chest drain.
	
#### ASPIRATION

	Identify 2nd intercostal space in midclavicular line.
	~
	Infiltrate with 1% lidocaine down to pleura overlying pneumothorax.
	~
	Insert 16G cannula into pleural space.
	~
	Connect cannula to 3 way tap and 50ml syringe.
	~
	Aspirate up to 2.5L air.
	~
	Stop if resistance felt or pt coughs excessively.
	~
	CXR to confirm resolution.	
	
CXR after 24h and after 7-10d.

Avoid air travel for 6wks after normal CXR.

Always avoid diving.
