# BRONCHIECTASIS

Chronic infection of the bronchi and bronchioles leading to permanent dilatation of these airways.

___
### CAUSES

Main organisms:

- H influenzae
- Strep pneumoniae
- Staph aureus
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Congenital: 

- CF 
- Young's syndrome
- primary ciliary dyskinesia
- Kartagener's syndrome

Post-infection:

- measles
- pertussis
- bronchiolitis
- pneumonia
- TB
- HIV

Other:

- bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body)
- allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)
- hypogammaglobulinaemia
- rheumatoid arthritis
- ulcerative colitis
- idiopathic

___
### CLINICAL FEATURES

Symptoms:

- persistent cough
- copious purulent sputum
- intermittent haemoptysis

Signs:

- finger clubbing
- coarse inspiratory crepitations
- wheeze (asthma, COPD, ABPA)

Complications:

- pneumonia
- pleural effusion
- pneumothorax
- haemoptysis
- cerebral abscess 
- amyloidosis

___
### TESTS
Sputum culture

CXR:

- cystic shadows
- thickened bronchial
	- tramline
	- ring shadows 

HRCT chest to assess extent and sitribution of disease.

Spirometry: often shows restrictive pattern - assess reversibility.

Bronchoscopy: 

- locate site of haemoptysis
- exclude obstruction
- obtain samples for cultures

Other:

- serum immunoglobulins
- CF sweat test
- Aspergillus precipitins/skin-prick test

___
### MANAGEMENT

Postural drainage twice daily - physio may help sputum expectoration/mucous drainage.

Abx - according to sensitivity. If 3+ exacerbations/y consider long-term abx.

Bronchodilators e.g. salbutamol neb may be useful in pts with COPD/asthma/ABPA.

Corticosteroids e.g. prednisolone for ABPA.

Surgery may be indicated in localised disease/to control severe haemoptysis.
