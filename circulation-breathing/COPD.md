# CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

COPD is a common progressive disorder characterised by airway obstruction with little or no reversibility.

	—> FEV1 <80% predicted, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7

Includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

Pts usually have COPD or asthma, not both.

Dx favoured by:

- Age of onset >35y
- Smoking (passive or active) or pollution
- Chronic dyspnoea
- Sputum production
- Minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV1 variation

Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as:

- cough
- sputum production on most days for 3 months of 2 successive years
- symptoms improve if stop smoking.
- no excess mortality if lung function normal

Emphysema is defined histologically as:

- enlarged air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles
- destruction of alveolar walls

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

10-20% >40yo


________________________

### PINK PUFFERS/BLUE BLOATERS

Ends of a spectrum.

Pink puffers:

- increased alveolar ventilation
- near normal PaO2
- normal or low PaCO2
- breathless but not cyanosed
- —> type 1 respiratory failure

Blue bloaters:

- decreased alveolar ventilation
- low PaO2
- high PaCO2
- cyanosed but not breathless
- may develop cor pulmonale
- respiratory centres relatively insensitive to CO2 and rely on hypoxic drive to maintain resp effort
- —> supplemental oxygen should be given with care


___

### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Symptoms:

- cough
- sputum
- dyspnoea
- wheeze

Signs:

- tachypnoea
- use of accessory muscles of respiration
- hyperinflation
- decreased cricosternal distance (<3cm)
- decreased expansion
- resonant or hyperresonant percussion note
- quiet breath sounds e.g. over bullae
- wheeze
- cyanosis
- cor pulmonale

NB. chest pain and haemoptysis uncommon in COPD, should suggest alternative dx.

MRC dyspnoea scale

		1. not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise
		2. short of breath when hurrying or walking up a slight hill
		3. walks slower than contemporaries on level ground because of breathlessness, or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace
		4. stops for breath after walking about 100m or after a few minutes on level ground
		5. too breathless to leave house, or breathless when dressing or undressing

### INVESTIGATIONS

FBC - increased PCV

CXR:

- hyperinfslation (>6 anterior ribs seen above diaphragm in midclavicular line)
- flat hemidiaphragms
- large central pulmonary arteries
- decreased peripheral vascular markings
- bullae

ECG: right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy (cor pulmonale).

ABG: decreased PaO2 +/- hypercapnia.

Lung function:

- obstructive + air trapping
- FEV1 <80% of predicted
- FEV1/FVC <0.7
- TLC increased
- RV increased
- DLCO decreased in emphysema

Measure post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm COPD dx.

_____

### ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY

Stage 1 MILD: FEV1 >80% of predicted

Stage 2 MODERATE: FEV1 50-79% of predicted

Stage 3 SEVERE: FEV1 30-49% of predicted

Stage 4 VERY SEVERE: FEV1 <30% of predicted

Disability in COPD can be poorly reflected by FEV1 - more complete assessment includes degree of airflow obstruction and disability, frequency of exacerbations and following known prognostic factors:

- FEV1
- TLCO
- brethlessness (MRC scale)
- health status
- exercise capacity e.g. 6 minute walk test
- BMI
- PaO2
- cor pulmonale

e.g. can use BODE index - BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise capacity.

### COMPLICATIONS

Acute exacerbations +/- infection.

Polycythaemia

Respiratory failure

Cor pulmonale (oedema, increased JVP)

Pneumothorax (ruptured bullae)

Lung carcinoma
____

### MANAGEMENT - STABLE COPD

#### 1. LIFESTYLE

All COPD pts should quit smoking. Unless contraindicated, offer NRT, varenicline or bupropion.

High BMI is a predictor of poor prognosis so encourage exercise, treat poor nutrition or obesity.

#### 2. VACCINATIONS
Pneumococcal vaccination and annual flu vaccine should be offered to all COPD pts.

#### 3. PULMONARY REHABILITATION
Should be available to all COPD pts who consider themselves functionally disabled, including those with recent hospitalisation for exacerbation.

Usually MRC grade 3 and above.

Incorporates physical training, disease education, nutritional, psychological and behavioural intervention.

#### 2. INHALED THERAPY

##### -> Corticosteroids

NB. Response to inhaled corticosteroids not predicted by oral corticosteroid reversibility tests.

##### -> Short-acting bronchodilators

Short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA) are initial empriical teratment for relief of breathlessness and exercise limitation.

Also can use short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) e.g. ipratropium.

##### -> Inhaled combination therapy

Once-daily long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) e.g. tiotropium in preference to 4x-daily SAMA where needed.

Can also add a long-acting beta-agonist.

-> LABA + corticosteroid e.g. Symbicort (budesonide + formoterol).

NB. Inhaled therapy can be delivered by inhaler, spacer or nebuliser.

#### 3. ORAL THERAPY

##### -> ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS
Maintenance use not usually recommended in COPD. Some pts may require maintenance when oral corticosteroids can't be withdrawn after and exacerbation. Keep dose low as possible.

##### -> THEOPHYLLINE
Should only use after trial of SABA and LABA, or where pts can't use inhaled therapy.

Special care needed in older people with this drug.

##### -> MUCOLYTIC THERAPY
Consider in pts with chronic productive cough.

#### 4. COMBINED ORAL/INHALED THERAPY
If pts symptomatic on monotherapy consider combined therapy. Effective combinations:

- beta2 agonist and theophylline
- anticholinergic and theophylline


#### 5. OXYGEN THERAPY

NB. Inappropriate use of oxygen in COPD pts can cause respiratory depression.

LTOT indicated in pts with COPD who have PaO2 <7.3kPa when stable OR PaO2 >7.3kPa and <8kPa when stable and one of:

- secondary polycythaemia
- nocturnal hypoxaemia
- peripheral oedema
- pulmonary HTN

May consider ambulatory oxygen therapy for some pts on LTOT.

NIV may be considered for pts who are hypercapnic/acidotic on LTOT.

____

### MANAGEMENT OF COPD EXACERBATION

Exacerbation is a sustained worsening of the pt's symptoms from their usual stable statewhich is beyond their normal variations and is acute in onset.

Common symptoms:

- worsening dyspnoea
- cough
- increased sputum production
- change in sputum colour

Need to consider whether to admit to hospital.

Management:

- nebulised bronchodilators
- prednisolone 30mg PO for 7-14 days
- Abx (if there is more purulent sputum than usual)

Aim to keep oxygen within target range.

May consider NIV or intubation.


If pt not responsive to nebulised bronchodilators then can use IV theophylline
