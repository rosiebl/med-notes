# MITRAL STENOSIS

Mitral stenosis = mitral valve opening restricted by thickening of the valve leaflets and fusion of the valve commissures.

Normal mitral valve orifice area is ~4-6cm”.

Symptoms usually begin when orifice <2cm”.


### CAUSES

Most common (>95% of cases): scarring following inflammation caused by **rheumatic fever**. 

Remember less than half of pts know they have had rheumatic fever as it can occur subclinically.

Other causes: 

- congenital 
- mucopolysaccharidoses
- endocardial fibroelastosis
- malignant carcinoid
- prosthetic valve
- use of ergot and/or serotonogenic drugs such as fenfluramine
- SLE
- mitral annular calcification due to ageing
- amyloidosis


### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Effect of mitral stenosis on circulation:

- flow of blood from L atrium to L ventricle impeded

- pressure in L atrium rises to compensate

- L atrium eventually dilates due to chronic pressure and volume overload

-

- flow of blood from lungs to L atrium impeded

- lungs become congested

- BP in lung vasculature rises: pulmonary arterial hypertension

-

- R ventricle works harder to pump blood through lungs bc of pulmonary arterial hypertension + increased pulmonary vascular resistance 

- R ventricular hypertrophy, then dilation

- back pressure from R ventricle —> tricuspid regurgitation and escalating R atrial pressure

### HISTORY

Common:

- Risk factors: streptococcal infection, female sex. 
- Hx of rheumatic fever.
- Dyspnoea
- Orthopnoea 
- Fatigue
- Palpitations
- Chest pain
- Age 40-50yo

Uncommon:

- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea
- Haemoptysis
- Hoarseness
- Dysphagia
- Systemic emboli
- Chronic bronchitis-like picture


### EXAMINATION

Common:

- Opening snap on auscultation

- Rumbling mid-diastolic murmur

- Loud P2

- Loud S1

- Tapping, non-displaced apex beat (palpable S1)

- Low volume pulse

- Neck vein distension

Uncommon:

- Peripheral oedema

- Ascites

- Irregularly irregular pulse

- Flushed cheeks


### COMPLICATIONS

- Pulmonary hypertension

- Emboli

- Pressure from large L atrium on local structures
	- hoarseness: recurrent laryngeal nerve
	- dysphagia: oesophagus
	- bronchial obstruction
	- infective endocarditis (rare)

### INVESTIGATIONS


##### ECG

- non-specific changes
- may show evidence of L atrium enlargement or atrial fibrillation

L atrial enlargement:

- P mitrale (broadening/bifid P wave) in lead II
- biphasic P wave in V1

Increased L atrial pressure can also cause atrial ectopy and AF.

L ventricular size/function not affected until pulmonary HTN occurs, so normal until that point. 

Once pulmonary HTN present, R ventricular hypertrophy occurs, shown by:

- shift of QRS axis to R
- dominant R wave in V1 and V2
- strain pattern of ST depression
- potentially RBBB


##### CXR

- L atrial enlargement (double shadow in R cardiac silhouette)
- pulmonary oedema
- mitral valve calcification


##### ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Key investigation to confirm dx and assess severity. Transoesophageal echo allows mitral valve to be seen particularly well. Significant stenosis if valve orifice <1cm”/m” body surface area.

##### DOPPLER 

Used to measure blood flow across mitral valve. Also estimate pulmonary artery pressure by measuring flow across tricuspid valve.

### MANAGEMENT

If in AF, rate control crucial, and anticoagulate with warfarin.

Diuretics decrease preload and pulmonary venous congestion.

If symptoms uncontrolled, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (if pliable, non-calcified valve), open mitral valvotomy or mitral valve replacement.

SBE/IE prophylaxis for GI/GU infected procedures.

Oral penicillin as prophylaxis against recurrent rheumatic fever.
