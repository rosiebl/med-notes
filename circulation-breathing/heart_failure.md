# HEART FAILURE

Heart failure is a condition where the heart cannot generate sufficient cardiac output to meet the body's requirements without increasing diastolic pressure.

### EPIDEMIOLOGY

1-3% general population.

~10% in elderly pts.

### CAUSES

#### SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE

Systolic: 

- inability of ventricle to contract normally
- --> decreased cardiac output
- ejection fraction <40%
- causes:
	- ischaemic heart disease
	- MI
	- cardiomyopathy
	
#### DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE

Diastolic:

- inability of heart to relax and fill normally
- --> increased filling pressure
- ejection fraction >50%
- causes:
	- constrictive pericarditis
	- tamponade
	- restrictive cardiomyopathy
	- hypertension

Systolic + diastolic failure usually coexist.


#### LOW-OUTPUT HEART FAILURE

Low output failure: cardiac output is low and fails to increase normally on exertion.

Causes:

- pump failure
- excessive preload
- chronic excessive afterload

Pump failure:

- systolic and/or diastolic heart failure
- low heart rate e.g. B-blockers, heart block, post-MI
- negatively inotropic drugs e.g. most antiarrhythmic agents

Excessive preload:

- mitral regurgitation
- fluid overload (e.g. NSAID fluid retention)
	- fluid overload may --> LVF in normal heart if renal function impaired/large vol involved
	- more common if cardiac function compromised/eldery

Chronic excessive afterload:

- aortic stenosis
- hypertension

#### HIGH-OUTPUT HEART FAILURE

High-output failure: output is normal or increased in the face of very high needs. Failure when output fails to meet needs.

Occurs with normal heart, but earlier in heart disease.

Causes:

- anaemia
- pregnancy
- hyperthyroidism
- Paget's disease
- arteriovenous malformation
- beri beri

Initially shows features of RVF; later LVF becomes evident.

### PRESENTATION


**Acute heart failure**: **new onset** acute or **decompensation** of chronic heart failure characterised by **pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema** ± signs of **peripheral hypoperfusion**.

**Chronic heart failure**: develops/progresses slowly. Venous congestino common, arterial pressure well maintained until v late.

Left ventricular and right ventricular failure can occur independently or together as **congestive cardiac failure** (CCF).

#### LEFT VENTRICULR FAILURE SYMPTOMS

Symptoms:

- dyspnoea

- poor exercise tolerance

- fatigue

- orthopnoea

- paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea

- nocturnal cough ± pink frothy sputum

- wheeze (cardiac 'asthma')

- nocturia

- cold peripheries

- weight loss

- muscle wasting

#### RIGHT VENTRICULAR FAILURE SYMPTOMS

Causes:

- LVF

- pulmonary stenosis

- lung disease

Symptoms:

- peripheral oedema - up to thighs, sacrum, abdo wall

- ascites

- nausea

- anorexia

- facial engorgement

- pulsation in neck and face - tricuspid regurgitation

- epistaxis



#### CCF DX: FRAMINGHAM CRITERIA

To dx there should be symptoms of failure + objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest.

Dx can be made using the Framingham criteria, which incorporates many of the signs of heart failure.

| FRAMINGHAM CRITERIA FOR CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE |
| ------ |
|  |
| Dx of CCF requires simultaneous presence of at least 2 major criteria or 1 major criterion with 2 minor criteria |
| **Major Criteria** |
| paroxysmal nocturnal dysponea |
| crepitations |
| S3 gallop |
| neck vein distention |
| acute pulmonary oedema |
| hepatojugular reflux |
| cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio >50% on CXR) |
| increased central venous pressure (>16cmH2O at R atrium) |
| weight loss >4,5kg in 5d w Rx |
| **Minor Criteria** |
| bilateral ankle oedema |
| dyspnoea on ordinary exertion |
| tachycardia (>120bpm) |
| nocturnal cough |
| hepatomegaly |
| pleural effusion |
| decrease in vital capacity by 1/3 from max recorded |

#### OTHER SIGNS

Signs not included in the Framingham criteria include:

- exhaustion

- cool peripheries

- cyanosis

- decreased BP

- narrow pulse pressure

- pulsus alternans

- displaced apex: LV dilatation

- RV heave: pulmonary hypertension

- murmurs of mitral or aortic valve disease

- wheeze (cardiac asthma)

#### NEW YORK CLASSIFICATION

1. Heart disease present, but no undue dyspnoea from ordinary activity
2. Comfortable at rest; dyspnoea on ordinary activities
3. Less than ordinary activity causes dyspnoea, which is limiting
4. Dyspnoea present at rest; all activity causes discomfort

### INVESTIGATIONS

- FBC
- U&E
- BNP (see below)
- CXR (see below)
- ECG
	- may indicate cause
	- look for evidence of ischaemia, MI, ventricular hypertrophy
- Echocardiogram
	- key investigation
	- may indicate cause - MI, valvular heart disease
	- confirm presence/absence of LV dysfunction
- Endomyocardial biopsy - rarely needed

#### CXR

ABCDE:

- **A**lveolar oedema: 'Bat's wings', classical perihilar shadowing
- Kerley **B** lines (variously attributed to interstitial oedema/engorged peripheral lymphatics)
- **C**ardiomegaly
- **D**ilated prominent upper lobe vessels
- Pleural **e**ffusion

Can also look for:

- peribronchial cuffing
- diffuse interstital or alveolar shadowing
- fluid in fissures


#### NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES

ANP = atrial natriuretic peptide. BNP = brain natriuretic peptide.

- increase GFR
- decrease renal Na reabsorption
- ANP partly blocks secretion of renin and aldosterone

Brain natriuretic peptide is mostly secreted from ventricular myocardium. Plasma BNP closely related to L ventricular pressure.

Things which affect secretion: 

- high BNP secretion in MI and LV dysfunction
- tachycardia
- glucocorticoids
- thyroid hormones
- vasoactive peptides e.g. endothelin-1, angiontensin II

Plasma BNP reflects myocyte stretch so is used to dx heart failure. High BNP distinguishes heart failure from other causes of dyspnoea better tan LV EF, ANP, and N-terminal ANP.

BNP levels:

- highest in decompensated heart failure
- intermediate in LV dysfunction but no acute exacerbation
- lowest if no heart failure/LV dysfunction
- higher in systolic than diastolic function
- highest in systolic + diastolic dysfunction
- increases in proportion to RV dysfunction, but less than LV

BNP >100ng/L dx heart failure better than other clinical variables/judgement.

BNP <50ng/L: heart failure unlikely.

### MGMT OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE

[For mgmt of acute heart failure, see other notes.]

- **lifestyle**: stop smoking, eat less salt, optimise weight + nutrition

- treat the **causes**, e.g. dysrhythmias, valve disease etc

- **treat exacerbating factors**, e.g. anaemia, thyroid disease, infection, HTN

- **avoid exacerbating factors**, e.g. NSAIDs (fluid retention), verapamil (-ve inotrope)

- **drugs**
	- diuretics
	
	- ACE inhibitors/ARB
	
	- B-blockers
	
	- spironolactone
	
	- digoxin
	
	- vasodilators


#### DRUGS

**Diuretics**:

- loop diuretics to relieve symptoms

- e.g. **furosemide** 40mg/24h PO or **bumetanide** 1-2mg/24h PO

- SE: hypokalaemia, renal impairment

- monitor U&E

- add potassium-sparing diuretic (e.g. **spironolactone**) if:

	- K <3.2mmol/L
	- predisposition to arrhythmias
	- concurrent digoxin rx (risk of digoxin toxicity)

- refractory oedema: consider adding thiazide e.g. **metolazone** 5-20mg/24h PO

**ACE inhibitors**:

- consider in all with LV systolic dysfunction

- SE: hyperkalaemia

- if cough is issue, **ARB** can be substituted e.g. **candesartan**. 

**B-blockers**:

- e.g. **carvedilol**

- initiate after diuretic + ACE-i

- use w/ caution: start low + go slow

**Spironolactone**:

- use in those still symptomatic despite optimal rx as listed above

- potassium-sparing diuretic, but minimal risk of hyperkalaemia even with ACE-i

**Digoxin**:

- helps symptoms even in sinus rhythm

- consider for pts with LV systolic dysfunctions who have signs/symptoms while receiving standard rx, including ACE-i and B-blockers, or pts with AF

- monitor U&E

- maintain K at 4-5mmol/L

- bear in mind increased risk of digoxin toxicity in concurrent rx with loop diuretics

**Vasodilators**:

- **hydralazine** + **isosorbide dinitrate** should be used in pts intolerant of ACE-i + ARBs

- hydralazine SE: drug-induced lupus

#### INTRACTABLE HEART FAILURE

Consider admitting for:

- strict bed rest ± Na/fluid restriction
- metolazone + IV furosemide
- opiates/IV nitrates
- daily weights, frequent U&E
- DVT prophylaxis, heparin + TED stockings

In extremis, try IV inotropes, although may be difficult towean pt off.

Consider:

- cardiac resynchronisation
- LV assist device
- transplantation


#### PALLIATIVE CARE

Treat/prevent comorbidities, e..g flu.

Good nutrition.

Involve GP: continuity of care + discussion of prognosis.

Deal with dyspnoea, pain (from liver capsule stretching), nausea, constipation, low mood.

- opiates
- O2

### PROGNOSIS

If admission is needed, 5y mortality ~75%.

BNP has prognostic value: higher BNP = higher cardiovascular + all-cause mortality.
