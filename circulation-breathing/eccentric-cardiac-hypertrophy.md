# ECCENTRIC CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY


Eccentric cardiac hypertrophy = muscles lengthens to increase ventricular volume without the wall thickening in proportion.


When the precipitating stress is volume overload, the ventricle responds by adding new sarcomeres in-series with existing sarcomeres. 

â€”> i.e. lengthening muscle rather than thickening

Results in ventricle dilation while maintaining normal sarcomere lengths, so heart can expand to receive greater volume of blood.

Normally wall thickness increases in proportion to increase in chamber radius, which does NOT happen here.
