# AORTIC STENOSIS

Aortic stenosis is obstruction of blood flow across the aortic valve due to pathological narrowing.

### CAUSES

Most common: senile calcification.

Others:

- congenital - bicuspid valve, e.g. William's syndrome
- rheumatic heart disease

### PRESENTATION

Classic triad:

- angina
- syncope
- heart failure

Also:

- dyspnoea
- dizziness
- faints
- systemic emboli if infective endocarditis
- sudden death


### SIGNS

- pulse: slow rising, narrow pulse pressure

- apex beat: heaving, non-displaced

- LV heave

- aortic thrill

- **ejection systolic murmur**

- murmur usually heard at base, L sternal edge and aortic area + radiates to carotids

- S1 usually normal, sounds change as disease progresses

### INVESTIGATIONS

##### ECG

- P-mitrale

- LVH with srtain pattern

- LAD (left anterior hemiblock)

- poor R wave progression

- L bundle branch block, or 

- complete AV block (calcified ring)

##### CXR

- LVH

- calcified aortic valve

- post-stenotic dilatation of ascending aorta

##### ECHO

Diagnostic.

Doppler echo:

- can estimate gradient over valves
- **severe stenosis if peak gradient is >50mmHg + valve area <1cm^3**
- aortic jet velocity >4m/s = increased complication risk

Cardiac catheter can assess:

- valve gradient
- LV function
- coronary artery disease
- risk: emboli

### DDx

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

### MANAGEMENT

If symptomatic, poor prognosis w/o surgery:

- angina/syncope = 2-3 yr survival
- cardiac failure = 1-2 yr survival
- moderate-severe disease treated medically can have 50% 2 yr survival

**Prompt valve replacement** usually recommended.

Asymptomatic w/ severe AS + deteriorating ECG: **valve replacement**.

**TAVI** (transcatheter aortic valve implantation) if medically unfit for surgery.
