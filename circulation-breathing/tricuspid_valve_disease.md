# TRICUSPID REGURGITATION

### CAUSES

- functional - RV dilatation (from pulmonary HTN from LV failure)
- rheumatic fever
- infective endocarditis (IVDU)
- carcinoid syndrome
- congenital
- drugs

Tricuspid valve most vulnerable to things arriving by vein, e.g. pathogens from IVDU reach the tricuspid valve first, as do toxins etc from distal carcinoid tumours.

### SYMPTOMS

- fatigue
- hepatic pain on exertion
- ascites
- oedema

Also dyspnoea + orthopnoea if cause is LV dysfunction.


### SIGNS

JVP: giant V waves and prominent y descent

RV heave

Pansystolic murmur

Pulsatile hepatomegaly

Jaundice

Ascites

### MANAGEMENT

Treat underlying cause.

Drugs:

- diuretic
- digoxin
- ACE-i

Valve replacement.

# TRICUSPID STENOSIS

### CAUSES

Main cause: rheumatic fever, which almost always occurs with mitral or aortic valve disease.

Also congenital, infective endocarditis.

### SYMPTOMS

- fatigue
- ascites
- oedema

### SIGNS

JVP: giant A wave, slow Y descent

Opening snap

Early diastolic murmu heard at L sternal edge in inspiration.

AF can occur.

### DX

Echo.

### MANAGEMENT

Diuretics.

Surgical repair.
