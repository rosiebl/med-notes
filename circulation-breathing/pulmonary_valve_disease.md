# PULMONARY STENOSIS

### CAUSES

Usually congenital.

Acquired causes: infective endocarditis, carcinoid syndrome.

### SYMPTOMS

- dyspnoea
- fatigue
- oedema
- ascites

### SIGNS

Dysmorphic facies (congenital causes).

JVP: prominent A wave

RV heave.

Mild stenosis:

- ejection click
- ejection systolic murmur (radiates -> L shoulder)
- widely split S2

Severe stenosis: murmur become slonger, obscures other sounds.


### INVESTIGATIONS

##### ECG

- RAD
- P-pulmonale
- RVH
- RBBB

##### CXR

Prominent main, R or L pulmonary arteries caused by post-stenotic dilatation.

Cardiac catheterisation is dx.

### MANAGEMENT

Pulmonary valvuloplasty or valvotomy.

# PULMONARY REGURGITATION

Caused by pulmonary HTN.

Decrescendo murmur in early diastole at L sternal edge.
