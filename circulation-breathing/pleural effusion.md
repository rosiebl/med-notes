# PLEURAL EFFUSION
A pleural effusion is when fluid collects between the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces of the thorax.

Types of effusion:

- transudates: protein <25g/L
- exudates: protein >35g/L
- haemothorax: blood
- empyema: pus
- chylothorax: chyle (lymph with fat)
- haemopneumothorax: blood and air
___
### CAUSES

Primary cause is imbalance between fluid production and fluid removal in the pleural space.

Exudates: due to alteration of local factors - mostly from increased leakiness of pleural capillaries secondary to infxn, inflammation or malignancy.

- pneumonia
- TB
- pulmonary infarction
- rheumatoid arthritis
- SLE
- bronchogenic carcinoma
- malignant metastases
- lymphoma
- mesothelioma
- lymphangitis carcinomatosis



Transudates: alteration of systemic factors

- increased venous pressure
	- cardiac failure
	- constrictive pericarditis
	- fluid overload
- hypoproteinaemia
	- cirrhosis
	- nephrotic syndrome
	- malabsorption
- hypothyroidism
- Meig's synrome (R pleural effusion and ovarian fibroma)

#### RISK FACTORS
Strong: chronic heart failure, pneumonia, malignancy, recent CABG.

Weak: PE, recent MI, occupational lung disease, RA, SLE, renal failure, drug induced, chylothorax.

___
### SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Symptoms: can be asymptomatic, or present with dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain and cough.

Signs: 

- on affected side:
	- decreased expansion
	- stony dull percussion
	- diminished breath sounds
	- bronchial breathing above effusion where lung compressed
	- tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance decreased
- tracheal deviation away from effusion if large

Look for signs of associated disease:

- malignancy: cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, radiation marks, mastectomy scar
- stigmata of chronic liver disease
- cardiac failure
- hypothyroidism
- rheumatoid arthritis
- butterfly rash of SLE

___
### INVESTIGATIONS

CXR:

- blunt costophrenic angles - small effusion
- water-dense shadow with concave upper border (meniscus)
	- flat upper border implies also pneumothorax

US: ueful to identify presence of fluid and guide aspiration.

Diagnostic aspiration: 

- 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below top of effusion, needle just above upper border of rib to avoid neurovascular bundle
- test for
	- clinical chemistry
	- bacteriology
	- cytology
	- immunology

Pleural biopsy if fluid analysis inconclusive.

See Oxford handbook for more details of pleural fluid analysis.

Pleural thickening

Pulmonary collapse and consolidation

Elevated hemidiaphragm

Pleural tumours/extrapleural fat

### MANAGEMENT

Management is of underlying condition.

Drainage: do thoracocentesis if effusion is symptomatic.

Pleurodesis with tetracycline, bleomycin or talc if repeated pleural effusions.

Surgery for persistent collections and increasing pleural thickness.

Physiotherapy can be helpful.
