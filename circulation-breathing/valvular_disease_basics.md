# VALVULAR DISEASE BASICS

### VALVES

Mitral valve: between L atrium and L ventricle. Bicuspid. The mitral valve apparatus consists of anterior and posterior leaflets, chordae tendineae, anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles, and mitral annulus. 

Tricuspid valve: between R atrium and R ventricle.

Aortic valve: between L ventricle and aorta.

Pulmonary semilunar valve: between R ventricle and pulmonary artery.

Blood flow through the heart: 

	deoxygenated blood IVC/SVC —> R atrium —> tricuspid valve —> R ventricle —> pulmonary valve —> lungs —> oxygenated blood pulmonary vein —> L atrium —> mitral valve —> L ventricle —> aortic valve —> aorta —> body


### PATHOLOGY

	—> STENOSIS: valves are narrowed and restricted in their opening.

	—> INCOMPETENCE: valves leak and cause regurgitation of blood.


If the valves don’t work properly then pressure and/or volume overload of the cardiac chambers can occur.
