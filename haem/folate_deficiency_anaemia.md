# FOLATE DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA

Macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia.

Folate is essential for DNA synthesis so deficiency leads to a megaloblastic anaemia, in which RBCs have delayed nuclear maturation in comparison to their cytoplasm.

Found in green veg, nuts, yeast and liver. 

Synthesised by gut bacteria.

Absorbed by duodenum/proximal jejunum.

Maternal deficiency causes fetal neural tube defects.

### CAUSES OF DEFICIENCY

- poor diet
	- poverty
	- alcoholics
	- elderly
- increased demand 
	- pregnancy
	- increased cell turnover
		- haemolysis
		- malignancy
		- inflammatory disease
		- renal dialysis
- malabsorption
	- coeliac
	- tropical sprue
- drugs
	- alcohol
	- anti-epileptics e.g. phenytoin, valproate
	- methotrexate
	- trimethoprim


### MANAGEMENT

Assess and treat underlying cause.

Rx: folic acid 5mg/day PO for 4/12.

Always combine with B12 unless known normal B12 limit (or can precipitate subacute combined degeneration of the cord).

Pregnancy: prophylactic doses from conception until at least 12/52 (400 micrograms/day). Helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia.

NB. If there is borderline folate deficiency, indicated by high homocysteine, 800 micrograms/day folic acid benefits cognition.
