# LEUKAEMIA

Leukaemia is a progressive, malignant disease of the blood-forming organs.

Characterised by distorted proliferation + development of leukocytes + precursors in the blood + bone marrow.

Classification:

- acute or chronic, depending on degree of cell differentiation (not time course of disease)
- lymphocytic/blastic or myeloid, depending on predominant type of cell involved

Exact cause unknown; genetic and environmental risk factors identified.

Typical signs/symptoms:

- fatigue
- weight loss
- fever
- pallor
- ecchymoses
- petechiae
- dyspnoea
- dizziness
- palpitations
- bleeding
- recurrent infections

Definitive dx often required bone marrow biopsy and/or blood analysis.

Main types of leukaemia:

- acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
- acute myeloid leukaemia
- chronic myeloid leukaemia
- chronic lymphocytic leukaemia


**ALL**: malignancy of lymphoid cells, affecting B or T cell lines. Arrests maturation and promotes **uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells**, with bone marrow failure and tissue infiltration.

**AML**: **neoplastic proliferation of blast cells** derived from marrow myeloid elements.

**CML**: **uncontrolled clonal proliferation of the haematopoeitic stem cell** leading to **myeloid cell hyperplasia** in BM. A myeloproliferative disorder.

**CLL**: **accumulation of mature B cells** that have escaped programmed cell death and undergone cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase.

[Blast cells are immature cell found in bone marrow. Not fully developed, so don't yet carry out any particular function in the body.]
