# ANAEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE

Most common anaemia in hospital patients.

2nd most common anaemia worlwide, after IDA.


### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

3 problems in anaemia of chronic disease:

1. poor use of iron in erythropoiesis
2. cytokine-induced shortening of RBC survival
3. decreased production of and response to erythropoietin

### CAUSES

Chronic disease, e.g. chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, renal failure.

### INVESTIGATIONS

Mild normocytic anaemia.

Ferritin normal or raised.

Also do:

- blood film
- B12
- folate
- TSH
- tests for haemolysis

Anaemia often multifactorial.


### MANAGEMENT

Treating underlying disease more rigourously may help, e.g. in rheumatoid.

Erythropoietin raises Hb.

Erythropoietin side effects: flu symptoms, HTN, mild rie in platelet count, thromboembolism.

Parenteral iron can overcome functional deficiency.
