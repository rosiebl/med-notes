# MACROCYTIC ANAEMIA

Macrocytosis = MCV >96 fL.

Megaloblast: cell in which nuclear maturation is delayed compared with the cytoplasm.


### CAUSES

Megaloblastic:

- B12 deficiency
- folate deficiency
- cytotoxic drugs

B12 and folate required for DNA synthesis so causes megaloblastic anaemia.


Non-megaloblastic:

- alcohol
- reticulocytosis, e.g. in haemolysis
- liver disease
- hypothyroidism
- pregnancy

Other haemotological disease:

- myelodysplasia
- myeloma
- myeloproliferative disorders
- aplastic anaemia

Pernicious anaemia is most common cause in Western countries.

### INVESTIGATIONS

B12 and folate deficiency have similar blood film and bone marrow biopsy appearance.

Blood film:

- B12/folate: hypersegmented polymorphs
- liver disease: target cells

Other tests:

- LFT, including gamma GT
- TFT
- serum B12 + folate
	- red cell folate - more reliable indicator

Bone marrow biopsy indicated if cause not found. Will likely show one of 4 states:

- megaloblastic
- normoblastic marrow, e.g. liver disease, hypothyroidism
- abnormal erythropoiesis, e.g. sideroblastic anaemia, leukaemia, aplasia
- increased erythropoiesis, e.g. haemolysis
