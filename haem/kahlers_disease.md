Neioplastic proliferation of plasma cells in bone marrow.

Monoclonal protein in serum and/or urine.

Produce organ or tissue impairment.

CRAB:

C - hypercalcaemia

R - renal insufficiency

A - anaemia

B - bone lesions

Hypercalcaemia:

- polydipsia
- polyuria
- anorexia
- vomiting
- constipation
- lethargy

Renal failure:

- protein overload - tubulopathic effect
- secondary hypercalcaemia
- amyloid deposition

Bone marrow failure - pancytopenia

Bone pain and destruction:

- most common symptom
- vertebral collapse and #
- lytic lesions of large bone and skull

Infections - lack normal Igs (immuneparesis) and neutropaenia

- macroglossia
- cardiac and renal failure, hepatosplenomegaly
- peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome

Blood film: rouleaux, leukoerythroblastic picture, rare PC

Bone marrow: abnormal PC infiltration.

Serum and urine electrophoresis.
