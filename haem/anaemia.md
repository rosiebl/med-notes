# ANAEMIA

Anaemia is defined as a low haemoglobin concentration. It may be due to low red cell mass, or increased plasma volume.

Low Hb level is:

- <135g/L in men
- <115g/L in women

Low red cell mass may be due to underproduction of increased loss of RBCs.


### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

Symptoms may be due to the underlying cause or the anaemia itself:

- fatigue
- dyspnoea
- faintness
- palpitations
- headache
- tinnitus
- anorexia
- angina if there is pre-existing coronary artery disease

There may be no signs even in severe anaemia. Pallor, including conjunctival pallor, is an unreliable sign.

In severe anaemia (Hb <80g/L) there may be signs of hyperdynamic circulation:

- tachycardia
- flow murmurs - ejection systolic, loudest over the apex
- cardiac enlargement

Rarely there are retinal haemorrhages.


### TYPES OF ANAEMIA

Look at the mean cell volume: normal MCV is 76-96 femtolitres.

#### MICROCYTIC

Low MCV.

Correlates with mean cell Hb of <27 picograms.

Causes:

- iron-deficiency anaemia

- thalassaemia: suspect if MCV is 'too low' for the Hb and RBC count is up

- sideroblastic anaemia

In thalassaemia and sideroblastic anaemia there is iron accumulation, so tests will show high serum iron, ferritin and low total iron-binding capacity.

#### NORMOCYTIC

Normal MCV.

When diagnosing normocytic anaemia, bear in mind that it is possible for a person to simultaneously have a micro- and a macrocytic anaemia, giving a normal MCV (e.g. in coeliac disease; see notes below on red cell distribution width).

Causes:

- acute blood loss

- anaemia of chronic disease (can be microcytic)

- bone marrow failure

- renal failure

- hypothyroidism (can be macrocytic)

- haemolysis (can be macrocytic)

- pregnancy

If WCC or platelets are low, suspedct bone marrow failure.


#### MACROCYTIC

High MCV.

Causes:

- B12 or folate deficiency

- alcohol excess, or liver disease

- reticulocytosis

- cytotoxics w.g. hydroxycarbamide

- myelodysplastic syndrome

- marrow infiltration

- hypothyroidism

- antifolate drugs e.g. phenytoin


#### HAEMOLYTIC

Do not fit the MCV classification because they may be normocytic or macrocytic, if there are many young (larger) RBCs and reticulocytes.

Suspect if there is: 

- reticulocytosis (>2% of RBCs; or reticulocyte count >100x10^9/L)
- mild macrocytosis
- low haptoglobin
- high bilirubin
- high urobilinogen
- often mild jaundice
	- no bilirubin in urine as it is a pre-hepatic jaundice
	
### RED CELL DISTRIBUTION WIDTH

Red cell distribution width represents the range in sizes in RBCs in a sample.

If the cells are all of similar size, the RCDW is low. If there is a wide range, with a high RCDW, it may be indicative of a mixed macro- and microcytic picture.
