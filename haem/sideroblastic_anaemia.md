# SIDEROBLASTIC ANAEMIA

Hypochromic microcytic anaemia.

20% older people with MCV <70 are not iron deficient.

Consider when microcytic anaemia not responding to iron treatment. 

Characterised by:

- ineffective eryhtropoiesis
- leads to increased iron absorption
- iron loading in marrow 
- ± haemosiderosis - endocrine, liver and heart damage due to iron

### CAUSES

Congenital: rare, X-linked.

Acquired: 

- idiopathic as one of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases
- following chemotherapy
- anti-TB drugs
- irradiation
- alcohol
- lead excess

### INVESTIGATIONS

Do ferritin to rule out IDA.

Look at blood film and marrow for sideroblasts. 

- Ring sideroblasts in the marrow, with a perinuclear ring of iron granules.

### MANAGEMENT

Treat the underlying cause.

Pyridoxine may help ± repeated transfusion for severe anaemia.
