# HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA

Haemolysis = premature breakdown of RBCs before normal lifespan of ~120d.

Can be intra- or extravascular.

- intravascular: in circulation
- extravascular: in reticuloendothelial system
	- macrophages of liver, spleen + bone marrow
	
Haemolysis may be asymptomatic. If bone marrow doesn't compensate --> haemolytic anaemia.
	
### ASSESSMENT

One approach is to confirm haemolysis and find the cause using the following questions.

#### INCREASED RBC BREAKDOWN

Is there increased red blood cell breakdown?

- anaemia with normal or high MCV

- high bilirubin: unconjugated, from haem breakdown (pre-hepatic jaundice)

- high urinary urobilinogen: (no urinary conjugsated bilirubin)

- high serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH): LDH is released from RBCs

#### INCREASED RBC PRODUCTION

Is there increased red blood cell production?

- high reticulocytes

- causes high MCV (reticulocytes are large immature RBCs)

- polychromasia

#### INTRA- OR EXTRAVASCULAR HAEMOLYSIS

Is the haemolysis intra- or extravascular?

**Extravascular**: splenic hypertrophy + splenomegaly.

Features of **intravascular** haemolysis:

- **high free plasma haemoglobin**: released from RBCs

- **methaemalbuminaemia**: free Hb --> haem + globin --> haem + albumin = methaemalbumin

- **low plasma haptoglobin**: mops up free plasma Hb, then removed by liver

- **haemosiderinuria**: haptoglobin capacity exceeded, free Hb filtered through kidneys + stored in renal tubular cells, detected in urine
	- implies chronic intravascular haemolysis

### Hx

- family hx

- race

- jaundice

- dark urine

- drugs

- previous anaemia

- travel

### EXAMINATION

- jaundice

- hepatosplenomegaly

- gallstones - pigmented, due to high bilirubin from haemolysis

- leg ulcers - due to poor blood flow

### INVESTIGATIONS

- FBC
- reticulocytes
- bilirubin
- LDH
- haptoglobin
- urinary urobilinogen
- thick/thin films for malaria (if travel hx)

Blood film may show polychromasia + macrocytosis due to reticulocytes.

Blood film may also point to dx:

- hypochromic microcytic anaemia: thalassaemia

- sickle cells: sickle cell anaemia

- schistocytes: microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia

- abnormal cells in haem malignancy

- spherocytes: hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia

- elliptocytes: hereditary elliptocytosis

- Heinz bodies/bite cells: G6PD deficiency

**Direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test)**: identifies RBCs coated with antibody or complement. **+ve result indicates immune cause of haemolysis**.

**Chromium labelling**: determines RBC lifespan + major site of breakdown. Rarely done.

**Osmotic fragility testing**: confirms membrane abnormalities identified on film.

**Hb electrophoresis**: detects haemoglobinopathies.

**Enzyme assays**: for when other causes have been excluded.

## CAUSES

### ACQUIRED

#### IMMUNE-MEDIATED & DIRECT ANTIGLOBULIN TEST +VE

##### DRUG INDUCED

Causing formation of RBC autoantibodies from binding to RBC membranes, e.g. penicillin, or production of immune complexes e.g. quinine.

##### AUTOIMMUNE HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA

Mediated by autoantibodies.

Causes mainly extravascular haemolysis + spherocytosis.

Classify by optimal binding temp to RBCs: warm or cold.

Warm AIHA: 

- IgG-mediated
- binding at body temp 37
- Rx: steroids/immunosuppression ± splenectomy

Cold AIHA:  

- IgM-mediated
- bind at low temp (<4)
- chronic anaemia made worse by cold
- often with Raynaud's or acrocyanosis
- Rx: keep warm. Chlorambucil may help.

##### PAROXYSMAL COLD HAEMOGLOBINURIA

Seen with viruses/syphilis.

Abs stick to RBCs in cold, causing self-limiting complement-mediated haemolysis on rewarming.

#### DIRECT ANTIGLBULIN/COOMBS -VE AIHA

2% of all AIHA.

Causes:

- AI hepatitis
- hepatitis B&C
- post flu + other vaccinations
- drugs e.g. piperacillin, rituximab

#### MICROANGIOPATHIC HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA

Mechanical disruption of RBCs in circulation, causing intravascular haemolysis + schistocytes.

Causes: haemolytic uraemic syndrome, TTP, DIC, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia.

Rx underlying disease.

#### INFECTION

Malaria: RBC lysis and 'blackwater fever' - haemoglobinuria.

#### PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HAEMOGLOBINURIA

Rare acquired stem cell disorder.

Haemolysis, marrow failure + thrombophilia.

Haemolysis happens esp at night --> haemoglobinuria.

Visceral thrombosis + PE predict poor outcome.

Rx: anticoagulation, ?eculizumab.

### HEREDITARY

#### ENZYME DEFECTS

##### GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE (G6PD) DEFICIENCY

Chief RBC enzyme defect.

X-linked.

Affects 100 million in Mediterranean, Africa, Middle/Far East. Mainly males.

Many asymptomatic.

May get **oxidative crises** due to low glutathione production. In attacks have **rapid anaemia + jaundice**.

Precipitants:

- drugs
	- primaquine
	- sulfonamides
	- aspirin
- *Vicia fava* - broad beans/favism
- illness
- henna

Rx: avoid precipitants, transfuse if severe.

##### PYRUVATE KINASE DEFICIENCY

Autosomal dominant.

Low ATP production --> low RBC survival.

Homozygotes have neonatal jaundice.

Symptoms: haemolysis with splenomegaly ± jaundice.

Rx: often not needed, splenectomy may help.

#### MEMBRANE DEFECTS

##### HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS

Autosomal dominant.

Prevalence: 1:3000.

Less deformable spherical RBCs so get trapped in spleen: extravascular haemolysis.

Signs: splenomegaly, jaundice.

##### HEREDITARY ELLIPTOCYTOSIS

Autosomal dominant.

Mostly asymptomatic, somewhat protects from malaria.

10% more severe.

##### HEREDITARY OVALOCYTOSIS + STOMATOCYTOSIS

Rare.

#### HAEMOGLOBINOPATHY

**Sickle cell disease.**

**Thalassaemia.**

[Thalassaemia: remember transfusion is for 2 reasons, to raise Hb AND to suppress ineffective extramedullary haematopoiesis. Iron overload causes major issues so iron-chelators crucial.]
