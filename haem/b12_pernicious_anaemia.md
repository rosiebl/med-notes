# B12 DEFICIENCY & PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA

Macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia.

B12 found in meat, dairy + fish (not veg).

Body stores sufficient for 4y.

- protein-bound
- released during digestion
- B12 binds to intrinsic factor in stomach
- complex absorbed in terminal ileum

In deficiency, synthesis of thymidine and therefore DNA impaired, so RBC production is slow.

### CAUSES

- dietary
	- vegans
- malabsorption
	- stomach: lack of IF
		- pernicious anaemia
		- post-gastrectomy
	- terminal ileum
		- ileal resection
		- Crohn's disease
		- bacterial overgrowth
		- tropical sprue
		- tapeworms
- congenital metabolic errors

### FEATURES

#### GENERAL

- anaemia symptoms

- 'lemon tinge': anaemia pallor + haemolysis mild jaundice

- glossitis

- angular cheilosis/stomatitis

#### NEUROPSYCHIATRIC

- irritability

- depression

- psychosis

- dementia

#### NEUROLOGICAL

Neuro signs of deficiency may occur without anaemia.

- parasthesiae

- peripheral neuropathy

Also:

##### SUBACUTE COMBINED DEGENERATION OF THE SPINAL CORD

Insidious onset w/ peripheral neuropathy.

Symmetrical losses in 2 areas:

1. dorsal column: sensory + LMN signs
2. corticospinal tract: motor + UMN signs

Classic triad:

1. extensor plantars (UMN)
2. absent knee jerks (LMN)
3. absent ankle jerks (LMN)

Usually starts with joint-position + vibration sense --> ataxia --> stiffness and weakness (if untreated).

May present with night falls due to ataxia + reduced vision.

Pain + temp sensation intact.

### PERNICIOUS ANAEMIA

Autoimmune atrophic gastritis, leading to achlorhydria + lack of gastric intrinsic factor secretion.

Incidence 1:1000, F:M ~1.6:1.

Usually >40yo, higher incidence if blood group A.

Associated with other autoimmune diseases, esp thyroid disease. 

Carcinoma of the stomach ~3x more common in pernicious anaemia.

### INVESTIGATIONS

- low Hb (30-110)

- high MCV

- if severe, low WCC + platelets

- low serum B12

- low reticulocytes (or normal as production impaired)

- hypersegmented polymorphs

- megaloblasts in marrow

Specific for PA:

- parietal cell Abs
	- in 90% of PA, but also 10-30% w/o PA
- IF Abs 
 	- specific for PA but lower sensitivity


### MANAGEMENT

Treat cause if possible.

If due to malabsorption, injections required.

Replanish stores with **hydroxocobalamin (B12) 1g IM alternate days**, e.g. for 2/52.

Maintenance: **1mg IM every 3/12** for life.

If cause is dietary, give PO after initial replenishment.

Prognosis: peripheral neuropathy usually improves within 3-6/12, but has little effect on cord signs.

Don't delay rx.
