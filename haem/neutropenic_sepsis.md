# NEUTROPENIC SEPSIS

When neutrophil count is <0.5 x 10^9/L, a neutropenic regimen is used:

- **full barrier nursing** if posisble

- hand washing

- side room

- **avoid IM** injections (risk of infected haemotoma)

- look for **source of infection** e.g. mouth, axilla, perineum, IVI site, take swabs

- check **bloods**: FBC, platelets, INR, U&E, LFT, LDH, CRP

- **cultures**: blood x3 (peripheral + Hickman line), urine, sputum, stool if diarrhoea

- wash perineum after defecation + use chlorhexadine for moist skin

- **oral hygiene** e.g. hydrogen peroxide mouth wash, Candida prophylaxis

- **vital signs** 4 hrly

- high-calorie **diet** - avoid foods with risk of microbial contamination

- cut flowers pose Pseudomonas risk

Be very cautious and have a high level of suspicion if patient experiencea any symptoms, even mild ones. 

Patients with neutropaenic sepsis are treated with the **sepsis 6** like all septic patients, but with the awareness that they are likely to deteriorate quickly.

Treat any known infection promptly.

Antibiotic use in neutropenia:

- if T >38 or T >37.5 on 2 occasion, OR if pt toxic, assume septicaemia

- start blind combination rx, e.g. **piperacillin-tazobactam** (+ **vancomycin** if Gram +ve suspected or isolated)

- continue till afebrile >72hrs or 5d course, + until neutrophils >0.5

- persistent fever despite abx: consider **CMV, fungi, central line infection**

- consider treatment for Pneumocystis: **co-trimoxazole** (trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole)

- remember TB
