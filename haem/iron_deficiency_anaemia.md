# IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA

Common: seen in ~14% of menstruating women.

### CAUSES

Blood loss, e.g. menorrhagia or GI bleeding.

Poor diet: may cause IDA in babies or children (but rarely in adults), in people on special diets, or where there is poverty.

Malabsorption, e.g. coeliac, causes refractory IDA.

Hookworm (GI blood loss) - common in countries where hookworm is endemic.

### SIGNS

Signs of chronic IDA are now rare. They include:

- koiloncyhia
- atrophic glossitis
- angular cheilosis
- rarely, post-cricoid webs (Plummer-Vinson syndrome)

### INVESTIGATIONS

Microcytic, hypochromic anaemia.

Anisocystosis + poikilocytosis.

Low MCV, MCH + MCHC.

Confirmed by low ferritin (also low serum iron + high total iron binding capacity, but less reliable).

High red cell protoporphyrin.

### Dx

If pt has low MCV and good hx of menorrhagia, iron can be started without further investigation.

Otherwise investigate GI blood loss e.g. gastroscopy, sigmoidoscopy, barium enema/colonoscopy etc.

Iron deficiency w/o obvious source of bleeding needs careful GI workup.

### MANAGEMENT

Treat cause.

**Oral iron e.g. ferrous sulphate 200mg/8h PO.**

SE of oral iron: nausea, abdo discomfort, diarrhoea/constipation, black stools.

Hb should rise 10g/L/week, with modest reticulocytosis.

Continue till replenished, for at least 3 months.

Reasons for failure:

- compliance (usually)
- GI disturbance - alter preparation
- continued blood loss
- malabsorption
- anaemia of chronic disease
- misdx e.g. thalassaemia

Rarely may need IV iron.
