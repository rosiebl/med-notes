# BLOOD TRANSFUSION

Should only be done if strictly necessary + no alternative.

When giving blood monitor TPR+BP every half hour.

### PRODUCTS

NB. Stored blood becomes more acidotic and hyperkalaemic with time.

**Whole blood**:

- rarely used
- indications:
	- exchange transfusion
	- grave exsanguination - crossmatched if possible, or O Rh-

**Red cells**:

- packed to haematocrit ~70%
- 1U increases Hb bu 10-15 g/L
- used to correct anaemia or blood loss
	- anaemia: transfuse till Hb ~80g/L
- as blood gets older becomes more acidotic, 

**Platelets**:

- 1U should increase platelet count by >20 x10^9/L
- failure to increase suggests refractoriness
- indications:
	- platelets <10 x10^9/L
	- haemorrhage
	- before invasive procedures to increase count to >50 x10^9/L

**Fresh frozen plasma**:

- indications: to correct clotting defects e.g.:
	- DIC
	- warfarin overdose where vitamin K too slow
	- liver disease
	- thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
- expensive
- same risks as blood transfusion

**Human albumin solution**:

- 4.5% or 20% protein solution
- used as protein replacement

**Cryoprecipitate**: souce of fibrinogen.

**Coagulation concentrates**: self-injected in haemophilia.

**Immunoglobulin**

### GROUP AND SAVE

**Group and save**: this is sufficient for most elective surgery. 

It can be used for patients with a determined blood group **without any atypical antibodies**. 

Blood is grouped by the lab and units of the correct group are saved. 

### COMPLICATIONS

In a transfusion reaction, always **STOP** the transfusion.

#### EARLY

- acute haemolytic reactions 

- anaphylaxis

- bacterial contamination

- transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

- non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reactions

- allergic reactions 

- fluid overload




##### Acute haemolytic reactions

ABO/Rh incompatibility.

e.g. ABO incompatibility:

- agitation
- rapid increase in temperature
- decreased BP
- flushing
- abdo/chest pain
- oozing venepuncture sites
- DIC

**STOP transfusion.**

Check ID/name on unit.

Tell haemotologist.

Send unit, FBC, U&E, cotting, cultures & urine (haemoglobinuria) to lab.

Keep line open with 0.9% IV saline.

Treat DIC.

##### Anaphylaxis

- bronchospasm
- cyanosis
- decreased BP
- soft tissue swelling

**STOP transfusion.**

Maintain airway + give oxygen. 

Contact anaesthetist.

##### Bacterial contamination

- rapid increased temperature
- low BP
- rigors

**STOP transfusion.**

Check ID of unit, tell haemotologist.

Send unit, FBC, U&E, cotting, cultures & urine to lab.

Start broad-spectrum abx.

##### Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

ARDS due to antileucocyte antibodies in donor plasma.

- dyspnoea
- cough
- CXR 'white out'

**STOP transfusion.**

100% oxygen.

Treat as ARDS.

Remove donor from donor panel.

##### Non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reaction

e.g. HLA antibodies

- shivering + fever, usually 30m-1h after starting transfusion

**SLOW or STOP transfusion.**

Give antipyretic e.g. paracetamol 1g.

##### Allergic reactions 

e.g. itch, urticaria, mild fever

**SLOW or STOP transfusion.**

Chlorphenamine 10mg slow IV/IM.

##### Fluid overload

- dyspnoea
- hypoxia
- tachycarida
- raised JVP
- basal crepitations

**SLOW or STOP transfusion.**

Give oxygen + diuretic e.g. furosemide 40mg IV initially.

Consider CVP line.



#### LATE

- infections
	- viruses: Hep B/C, HIV
	- bacteria
	- protozoa
	- prions
- iron overload
- graft-vs-host disease
- post-transfusion purpura
	- potentially lethal
	- fall in platelet count 5-7d post-transfusion
	- requires rx with IV immunoglobulin + platelet transfusions

### TRANSFUSION IN HEART FAILURE

If Hb <50g/L in heart failure, transfusion necessary to restore pt to safe level, e.g. 60-80.

Must be done wiht care due to risk of fluid overload.

Each unit given over 4h, with furosemide given with alternate units (not at same time).

Chick for raised JVP + basal crackles - consider CVP.

If CCF worsening and transfusion vital, try exchange transfusion.

### AUTOLOGOUS TRANSFUSION

Patients' own blood stored for use in transfusion post-op.

Erythropoietin can increase yield of blood.

Intraoperative cell salvage with retransfusion also being used more.
