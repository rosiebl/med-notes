# GALLSTONES

**Cholelithiasis** refers to the presence of solid concretions in the gallbladder (i.e. gallstones).

Symptoms ensue if the gallstone obstructs the cystic or the bile duct.

### THE GALLBLADDER

The gallbladder stores bile secreted by the liver and releases it into the duodenum via the cystic duct, which joins the common bile duct before draining into the intestine.

Bile contains:

- cholesterol
- bile pigments (from broken down blood)
- phospholipids

Changes to the concentrations of the components can form different gallstones.


### TYPES OF STONE

**Pigment stones**: 

- <10%
- small, friable, irregular
- cause: haemolysis

**Cholesterol stones**:

- large
- often solitary
- causes:
	- women
	- age
	- obesity

Admirands triangle: high risk of stone if have low lecithin, low bile salts, high cholesterol.

**Mixed stones**:

- faceted
- calcium salts, pigment and cholesterol

### PREVALENCE

8% of those >40y.

90% remain asymptomatic.



### RISK FACTORS FOR CHOLELITHIASIS

Strong:

- increasing age
- female sex
- Hispanic and Native-American ethnicity
- FHx of gallstones
- gene mutations
- pregnancy/exogenous oestrogen
- obesity
- prolonged fasting/rapid weight loss
- total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
- octreotide
- ceftriaxone
- terminal ileum disease or resection
- haemoglobinopathy
- diabetes and the metabolic syndrome

Weak: low-fibre diet

Risk factors for gallstones becoming symptomatic:

- smoking
- parity


### COMPLICATIONS OF GALLSTONES

Gallbladder and cystic duct:

- biliary colic
- acute and chronic cholecystitis
- mucocele
- empyema
- carcinoma
- Mirizzi's syndrome

Bile ducts:

- obstructive jaundice
- cholangitis
- pancreatitis

Gut:

- gallstone ileus

### BILIARY COLIC

Biliary colic is the term used to describe a type of pain related to the gallbladder that occurs when a gallstone transiently obstructs the cystic duct and the gallbladder contracts.

Gallstones are symptomatic with **cystic duct obstruction** or if passed into the **common bile duct**.

Presents with **RUQ pain** which radiates to the back ± jaundice.

No fever or high WCC. 

Dx:

- may overlap as part of a spectrum of gallstone disease
- urinalysis/ECG/CXR help exclude DDx

Treatment:

- analgesia
- rehydrate
- NBM
- elective laproscopic cholecystectomy

Pts with biliary colic are more likely to experience recurrent pain and are at higher risk of other complications from gallstones.


### ACUTE AND CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS

Acute cholecystitis is acute gallbladder inflammation, and occurs in around 10% of patients with symptomatic gallstones.

Chronic cholecysitits is chronic inflammation ± colic.

See notes on cholecystitis for more detail.

### OBSTRUCTUVE JAUNDICE WITH CBD STONES

See ntoes on jaundice for more detail.

If LFTs are worsening:

- ERCP with sphincterotomy ± biliary trawl
- may need cholecystectomy
- or may need open surgeyr with CBD exploration

If CBD stones are suspected before surgery they should be identified with MRCP.

### CHOLANGITIS

Infection of the biliary tree, most commonly caused by obstruction.

Symptoms (Charcot's triad):

- RUQ pain
- jaundice
- rigors

Less severe: biliary obstruction with inflammation and bacterial seeding and growth in the biliary tree.

More severe: purulent biliary tree contents, with evidence of sepsis, hypotension, MOF, mental state changes.

Treatment: abx e.g. cefuroxime and metronidazole.


#### BILIARY COLIC/CHOLECYSTITIS/CHOLANGITIS?

DDx | RUQ pain | Fever/WCC up | Jaundice
--- | --- | --- | ---
Biliary colic | Y | N | N
Acute cholecystitis | Y | Y | N
Cholangitis | Y | Y | Y

### GALLSTONE ILEUS

Gallstone erodes through the gallbladder into the duodenum and may then obstruct the terminal ileum.

AXR shows:

- air in common bile duct = pneumobilia
- small bowel fluid levels
- stone

Bouveret's syndrome: duodenal obstruction. Rarer.


### PANCREATITIS

Acute pancreatitis is a self-limiting and reversible pancreatic injury associated with mid-epigastric abdominal pain and raised serum pancreatic enzymes.

Commonly caused by gallstones.

### MUCOCELE/EMPYEMA

Obstructed gallbladder fills with mucous secreted by the gallbladder wall or pus.

### SILENT STONES

Do elective surgery on people with:

- sickle cell 
- immunosuppression
- ?diabetes
- all calcified/porcelain gallbladders

### MIRIZZI'S SYNDROME

A stone in the gallbladder presses on the bil duct causing jaundice.

### GALLBLADDER PERFORATION

Rare because of dual blood supply:

- heatic artery via cystic artery
- small branches of hepatic artery in the gallbladder fossa

### OTHER

Causes of cholecystitis and biliary colic other than gallstones are rare.

Consider:

- infection
	- typhoid
	- cryptosporidiosis
	- brucellosis
- cholecystokinin release
- parenteral nutrition
- anatomical abnormality
- polyarteritis nodosa
