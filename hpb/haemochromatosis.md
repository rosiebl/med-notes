# HEREDITARY HAEMOCHROMATOSIS

Hereditary haemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism which increased intestinal iron absorption leads to iron deposition in joints, liver, heart, pancreas, pituitary, adrenals + skin.

Middle-aged men more frequently + severely affected than women.

Disease tends to present ~10y later in women as menstrual blood loss is protective.

### GENETICS

One of the commonest inherited conditions in those of Northern European ancestry.

Carrier rate ~1/10.

Frequency of homozygosity ~1/200-400.

Gene responsible for most HH: HFE, found on short arm of chromosome 6.

2 major mutations: C282Y + H63D.

Penetrance unknown but <100%.

### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

Early on - nil, or:

- tiredness

- arthralgia: 2nd + 3rd MCP joints + knee pseudogout

- decreased erections

Later:

- slate-grey skin pigmentation

- signs of chronic liver disease

- hepatomegaly

- cirrhosis

- dilated cardiomyopathy

- osteoporosis

Endocrinopathies:

- diabetes mellitus: 'bronze diabetes' from iron deposition in pancreas

- hypogonadism from pituitary dysfunction (not testicular iron deposition, ?via cirrhosis)

- hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism


### INVESTIGATIONS

**Bloods**:

- high LFTs

- high serum ferritin: >1mg/L very suggestive, but any inflammatory process can incerase ferritin

- transferrin saturation >45%

- glucose: ?DM

- HFE genotype

**Images**:

- chondrocalcinosis

- **liver MRI**: iron overload

**Liver biopsy**: Perl's stain quantifies iron loading + assesses severity.

**ECG/ECHO** if cardiomyopathy suspected.

### MGMT

**Venesection**:

- ~1U/1-3 weeks until ferritin <50 micrograms/L

- may take 2y

- maintenance needed for life: 1U/2-3 months

Consider **desferrioxamine** if intolerant to venesection.

Monitor LFT + glucose/diabetes. HbA1C amy be falsely low as venesection decreases time for glycosylation.

**Over the counter drugs**: ensure vitamin preparations contain no iron.

**Diet**: 

- well-balanced low-iron diet may help

- tea/coffee/red wine with meals decrease iron absorption

- fuit/fruit juice (vitamin C) + white wine increase absorption

**Screening**: 

- serum ferritin + genotype

- genetic screen for 1st degree relatives even if normal LFTs + asymptomatic

### PROGNOSIS

Venesection --> normal life expectancy if non-diabetic + non-cirrhotic.

Liver histology can improve.

Arthropathy may improve or worsen.

Gonadal failure irreversible.

If cirrhotic:

- 22-30% get haptocellular cancer
- higher risk if:
	- age >50
	- HbSAg +
	- alcohol abuse

### SECONDARY HAEMOCHROMATOSIS

May occur if have many transfusions: ~40L in total.

To reduce need, find out if haematological condition responds to erythropoietin or marrow transplantation before irreversible effects of iron overload too great.
