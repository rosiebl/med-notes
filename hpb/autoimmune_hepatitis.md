# AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory liver disease of unknown cause characterised by suppressor T cell defects with **autoantibodies directed against hepatocyte surface antigens**.

Classified by autoantibody (see below).

Bimodal distribution - predominantly affects women 10-30y or >40y.

### PRESENTATION

Most present with:

- acute hepatitis

- signs of autoimmune disease, e.g.

	- fever

	- malaise

	- urticarial rash

	- polyarthritis

	- pleurisy

	- pulmonary infiltration

	- glomerulonephritis 
	
Others present with gradual jaundice, or are asymptomatic and dx incidentally with signs of chronic liver disease.

Amenorrhoea common.

Disease tends to attenuate during pregnancy.

Complications: of cirrhosis + drug therapy.

#### ASSOCIATIONS

- pernicious anaemia

- ulcerative colitis

- glomerulonephritis

- autoimmune thyroiditis

- autoimmune haemolysis

- diabetes mellitus

- primary sclerosing cholangitis

- HLA A1, B8 + DR3 haplotype

### INVESTIGATION

Bloods:

- serum bilirubin raised

- ASt, ALT, ALP raised

- hypergammaglobulinaemia, esp IgG

- +ve antibodies (see classification)

Signs of hypersplenism: anaemia, low WCC, low platelets.

Liver biopsy:

- mononuclear infiltrate of portal + periportal areas
- piecemeal necrosis Â± fibrosis

Cirrhosis ~ worse prognosis.

MRCP helps exclude PSC if ALP disproportionately high.

### CLASSIFICATION

Type 1:

- 80%

- typical pt female <40y

- antismooth muscle antibodies (**ASMA**) +ve in 80%

- antinuclear antibody (**ANA**) +ve in 10%

- **IgG** raised in 97%

- good response to immunosuppression in 80%

- 25% cirrhosed at presentation

Type 2:

- commoner in Europe than USA

- more often seen in children

- more commonly progresses to cirrhosis

- less treatable

- antiliver/kidney microsomal type 1 (**LKM1**) antibodies +ve

- ASMA + ANA -ve

Type 3: 

- like type 1, but ASMA + ANA -ve

- Abs against soluble liver antigen (**SLA**) or **liver-pancreas antigen antibody**

### MGMT

#### IMMUNOSUPPRESSION

**Prednisolone**: 

- 30mg/d PO for 1 month

- decrease by 5mg per month to maintenance

- maintenance dose 5-10mg/d PO

Can sometimes stop corticosteroids after 2y but relapse in 50-86%.

**Azathioprine**:

- 50-100mg/d PO

- can use as steroid-sparing agent to maintain remission

Remission acheivable in 80% pts within 3y.

SE are big problem, heped by switch to budesonide, e.g. in non-cirrhotic AI hepatitis.

#### LIVER TRANSPLANT

Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if refractory to medical treatment.

Recurrence may occur.

Effective: actuarial 10y survival 75%.

### PROGNOSIS

Doesn't seem to matter whether symptomatic or asymptomatic at presentation: 10y survival 80%.

Presence of cirrhosis at presentation reduces survival from 94% to 62%.

Overlap sydromes: AIH-PBC worse than AIH-AIC (AI cholangitis).
