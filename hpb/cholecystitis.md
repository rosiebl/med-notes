# ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS

Acute cholecystitis is an acute gallbladder inflammation and is a major complication of cholelithiasis or gallstones.

Develops in ~10% of pts with symptomatic gallstones.

### CAUSES

Caused by stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the gallbladder:

- impacted gallstone in neck of gallbladder or the cystic duct: 90%
- bile inspissation blocking cystic duct due to dehydration (congealing, due to dehydration)
- bile stasis blocking cystic duct (due to trauma or severe systemic illness)

### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

- continuous epigastric or RUQ pain

- pain refers to R shoulder

- vomiting

- fever

- local peritonism

- gallbladder mass

- Murphy's sign

- may be a palpable phlegmon

Main difference from biliary colic is the **inflammatory component** - local peritonism, fever, high WCC.

Murphy's sign:

- lay 2 fingers over RUQ; ask pt to breathe in
- causes pain and arrest of inspiration
- as inflamed gallbladder impinges on your fingers
- do on both sides!
- only positive if same test in LUQ doesn't cause pain

Phlegmon: RUQ mass of inflamed omentum and bowel.

### INVESTIGATIONS

WCC high.

Ultrasound:

- thick-wallked, shrunken gallbladder
- pericholecystic fluid
- stones
- common bile duct - dilated if >6mm

HIDA cholescintigraphy - useful if dx uncertain after US.

Plain AXR:
- only shows 10% of stones
- may identify porcelain gallbladder (~15% association with cancer)



### TREATMENT

- NBM

- pain relief

- IVI

- e.g. cefuroxime

**Laparoscopic cholecystectomy** is rx of choice for all pts fot for GA.

Open surgery required if gallbladder perforates.

If elderly or high risk/unsuitable for GA, consider percutaneous cholecystotomy - can still do cholecystectomy later.

**Percutaneous cholecystotomy** is rx of choice for acalculous cholecystitis.

# CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS

Chronic inflammation of the gallbladder Â± colic.

### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

'Flatulent dyspepsia'

- vague abdominal discomfort

- distension

- nausea

- flatulence

- fat intolerance: fat stimulates cholecystokinin release and gallbladder contraction

### INVESTIGATIONS

US to find stones and assess common bile duct diameter.

MRCP to find common bile duct stones.

### TREATMENT

**Cholecystectomy**.

If US show dilated common bile duct with stones, do **ERCP + sphincterotomy** before surgery.

If symptoms persist after surgery consider:

- hiatus hernia
- IBS
- peptic ulcer disease
- relapsing pancreatitis
- tumour
