# HEPATITIS

**Hepatitis A and E** are feacal-oral. A is common, particularly with travellers. Rx is supportive because it's usually self-limiting. E would be suspected if the disese is more severe in pregnant women or if A is excluded.

**Hepatitis B and C** are from exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluids containing blood. e.g. via sexual contact, blood transfusions, sharing needles, vertical transmission during childbirth. 

D is a subviral satellite because it can only propogate in the presence of B.
