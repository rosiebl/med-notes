# a1-ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY

a1-antirypsin deficiency is an autosomal codominant genetic disorder which commonly affects lung (emphysema) and liver (cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer).

Prevalence: ~1/4000 (higher in Caucasians).

### GENETICS

Gene found on chromosome 14.

Carrier frequency 1:10.

Genetic variants typed by electrophoretic mobility:

- medium: M
- slow: S
- very slow: Z

S + Z due to single amino acid substitution, resulting in decreased A1AT production.

Genotypes:

- **PiMM**: normal
- **PiZZ**: homozygote
- **PiMZ/PiSZ**: heterozygote, low risk of developing lvier disease


### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

A1AT is a glycoprotein. 

In family of **ser**ine **p**rotease **in**hibitors: deificiency = serpinopathy.

A1AT deificiency is chief genetic cause of liver disease in children.

Lung A1AT protects against tissue damage from neutrophil elastase - process also induced by cigarette smoking. 

Variants can polymerise and accumulate in the liver resulting in hepatic failure.

### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

Symptomatic pts usually have PiZZ genotype.

- **dyspnoea from emphysema**

- **cirrhosis**

- **cholestatic jaundice**

Cholestasis often remits in adolescence.

Think of A1AT deficiency in all young pts who present with COPD.

### ASSOCIATIONS

- hepatocellular cancer

- asthma

- pancreatitis

- gallstones

- Wegener's granulomatosis

### INVESTIGATIONS

Bloods: **serum A1AT levels** usually decreased - inflammation may hide low level as is part of acute phase response.

**Liver biopsy**: 

- periodic acid Schiff (PAS) +ve
- diastase-resistant globules

**Phenotyping** to distinguish SZ + ZZ phenotypes.

**Prenatal dx** possible by DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples at 11-13 weeks gestation.

**Lung density measurement** with **CT** may be better than lung function tests for predicting disease progression + mortality.


### MGMT

**Supportive Rx** for emphysema + liver disease sufficient for some.

--> **Quit smoking**.

**IV A1AT** from human palsma may help prevent COPD exacerbations (uncertain).

**Liver transplant** for decompensated cirrhosis.

**Inhaled A1AT** has been tried in lung disease.

### PROGNOSIS

Some have life-threatening symptoms in childhhod; others remain asymptomatic + healthy into old age.

Worse prognosis if:

- male
- smoker
- obese

Emphysema cause of death in most.

Liver disease cause of death in ~5%.

Cirrhosis Â± hepatocellular cancer affects 25% of A1AT-deificient adults >50y.
