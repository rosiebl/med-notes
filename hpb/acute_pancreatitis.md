# ACUTE PANCREATITIS

Acute pancreatitis is a **self-limiting** and **reversible** pancreatic injury associated with mid-epigastric abdominal pain and raised serum pancreatic enzymes.

There is **self-perpetuating pancreatic inflamamtion** by enzyme-mediated **autodigestion**.

This causes acinar cell injury with local and systemic inflammatory responses. 

Inflammation can range from mild **oedema** to peri-pancreatic **necrosis**, sometimes with rapid progression.

Oedema and fluid shifts cause **hypovolaemia** as extracellular fluid is trapped in the gut, peritoneum and retroperitoneum.

~50% of cases with necrosis are further complicated by **infection**.

Pancreatitis is mild in 80% of cases, 20% develop severe complicated and life-threatening disease.

~12% die.


### CAUSES

GET SMASHED

Gallstones

Ethanol

Trauma

Steroids

Mumps

Autoimmune (PAN)

Scorpion venom

Hyperlipidaemia, hypothermia, hypercalcaemia

ERCP and emboli

Drugs

Also pregnancy and neoplasia, or no cause found.

#### RISK FACTORS

- middle aged women

- young to middle aged men

- HIV/AIDS

- SLE

- Sjogren's syndrome

### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

Symptoms:

- gradual or sudden severe epigastric or central abdominal pain radiating to the back

- vomiting prominent


Signs:

- tachycardia

- fever

- jaundice

- shock

- ileus

- rigid abdomen ± local/general tenderness

- Cullen's sign: periumbilical bruising

- Grey Turner's sign: bruising of flanks

	- from blood vessel autodigestion and retroperitonal haemorrhage


### INVESTIGATIONS

Raised serum amylase: 

- over 1000u/mL or ~3x upper limit of normal
- degree of elevation not related to severity
- may be normal as levels fall in 1st 24-48h

Serum lipase: more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis.

ABG: monitor oxygenation and acid-base status.

AXR: 

- no psoas shadow (increased retroperitoneal fluid)
- 'sentinel loop' of proximal jejunum from ileus (solitary air-filled dilatation)

Erect CXR helps exclude other causes e.g. perforation.

CT is standard to assess severity and complication, MRI may be better.

US if gallstones + high AST.

ERCP if LFTs worsen.

CRP >150ml/L at 36h after admission is predictor of severe pancreatitis.


#### DDx

Any acute abdomen.

MI

### SEVERITY ASSESSMENT

Modified Glasgow criteria for predicting severity of pancreatitis.

3+ factors in 48h of onset suggest severe pancreatitis, should prompt ITU transfer.

PANCREAS | -
--- | ---
PaO2 | <8 kPa
Age | >55y
Neutrophilia | WBC >15 x 10^9/L
Calcium | <2 mmol/L
Renal function | urea >16 mmol/L
Enzymes | LDH >600 iu/L; AST >200 iu/L
Albumin | <32 g/L (serum)
Sugar | blood glucose >10 mmol/L


### MANAGEMENT

Severity assessment essential.

NBM, likely to need NG tube.

Analgesia: pethidine or morphine.

Hourly monitoring with daily bloods and ABG.

ITU/O2 if PaO2 is decreasing.

Abscess formation or panreatic necrosis: 

- consider parenteral nutrition 
- ± laparotomy + debridement

Abx may help in specific severe disease. No consensus on prophylactic use in necrosis.

ERCP + gallstone removal may be needed if there is progressive jaundice.

Repeat imaging.

### COMPLICATIONS

#### EARLY

- shock

- renal failure

- DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation)

- sepsis

- low calcium

- high glucose (transient; 5% need insulin)

#### LATE

Pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst with fever, a mass ± perisistent high amylase/LFT. May resolve or need drainage.

Abscesses - need drainage.

Bleeding - from elastase eroding a vessel e.g. splenic artery. Embolisation may be life-saving.

Thrombosis - may occur in splenic/gastroduodenal arteries, or colic branches of the SMA. Causes bowel necrosis.

Fistulae - normally close spontaneously. If purely pancreatic do not irritate skin.

Recurrent oedematous pancreatitis - some pts suffer so often that pancreatectomy is considered.
