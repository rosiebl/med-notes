# LIVER TRANSPLANTATION

### ACUTE LIVER FAILURE

**KCH liver transplant criteria**: fulfilling these criteria predicts poor outcome in acute liver failure.

	Paracetamol-induced liver failure	
	
	- arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion
	
	OR all of the following:
	
	- prothrombin time >100s
	- creatinine >300 micromol/L
	- grade III or IV encephalopathy
	
-
	
	Non-paracetamol liver failure
	
	- prothrombin time >100s
	
	OR 3 out of 5 of the following:
	
	- drug-induced liver failure
	- age <10 or >40y
	- >1wk from 1st jaundice to encephalopathy
	- prothrombin time >50s
	- bilirubin >300 micromol/L

Transplants are cadaveric (heart-beating or non-heart-beating) or living (R lobe).

Refer earlier rather than later e.g. when ascites is refractory or after a 1st episode of bacterial peritonitis.

Contraindications:

- active sepsis
- decreased life expectancy (~ less than 2y) from concurrent diseases
- psychosocial factors precluding immunosuppression



### CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE

Indication for liver transplant in chronic disease is generally because of advanced cirrhosis. Childs-Pugh grading used as a selection criterion.

#### INDICATIONS

- advanced cirrhosis secondary to:
	- alcoholic liver disease
	- hepatitis (B/C/autoimmune)
	- primary biliary cirrhosis
	- Wilson's disease
	- alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency
	- primary sclerosing cholangitis
- hepatocellular cancer
	- 1 nodule <5cm or 2-3 nodules <3cm
	
#### CONTRAINDICATIONS

- extrahepatic malignancy
- multiple tumours
- severe cardiorespiratory disease
- systemic sepsis
- HIV infection
- non-compliance with drug therapy


### IMMUNOSUPRESSION REGIMES

- ciclosporin
- tacrolimus + azathioprine
- mycophenolate mofetil + prednisolone

### COMPLICATIONS

#### REJECTION

Hyperacute rejection is because of ABO incompatibility.

Acute rejection: 

- T cell mediated
- at 5-10 days
- pt feels unwell with pyrexia and tender hepatomegaly
- often managed with immunosuppression.

#### OTHER

- sepsis, esp Gram -ve and CMV

- hepatic artery thrombosis

- chronic rejection, at 6-9/12

- disease recurrence

- graft-versus-host disease

### PROGNOSIS

Average pt survival at 1y is ~80%.

5y survival is 60-90%, depending on the pre-op disease.

Poor pre-transplant renal function may predict poor outcome.
