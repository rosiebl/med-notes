# CIRRHOSIS

Cirrhosis is a diffuse pathological process characterised histologically by bridging **fibrosis** and conversion of normal tissue to structurally abnormal nodules called **regenerative nodules**.

### CAUSES

Chronic alcohol abuse

Chronic HBV or HCV infection

Genetic:

- haemochromatosis
- alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency
- Wilson's disease

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

Autoimmunity:

- primary biliary cirrhosis
- primary sclerosing cholangitis
- autoimmune hepatitis

Drugs, e.g. amiodarone, methyldopa, methotrexate

### SIGNS

Range from none (just high LFTs) to decompensated end-stage liver disease.

Signs of chronic liver disease:

- leuconychia: white nails with lunulae undemarcated, from hypoalbuminaemia

- Terry's nails: white proximally but distal 1/3 reddened by telangiectasia

- clubbing

- palmar erythema

- hyperdynamic circulation

- Duputyren's contracture

- spider naevi: >5 abnormal

- xanthelasma

- gynaecomastia

- atrophic testes

- loss of body hair

- parotid enlargement

- hepatomegaly **OR** small liver in late disease

### COMPLICATIONS

Increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

#### DECOMPENSATION

Cirrhosis may be present for many years before it causes jaundice, ascites or encephalopathy.

There are various signs that cirrhosis may be going to decompensate, which if halted may prevent this happening. Look out for:

- dehydration
- constipation
- covert alcohol use
- infection, e.g. spontaneous peritonitis
- opiate overuse
- occult GI bleed

#### HEPATIC FAILURE

See notes on liver failure.

- coagulopathy 
	- decreased factors II, IV, IX & X causes increased INR
- encephalopathy
	- asterixis
	- confusion/coma
- hypoalbuminaemia
	- leukonychia
	- oedema
- sepsis
	- pneumonia
	- septicaemia
- spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
- hypoglycaemia

#### PORTAL HYPERTENSION

See notes on portal HTN.

- ascites
- splenomegaly
- portosystemic shunt including oesophageal varices (± life-threatening upper GI bleed)
- caput medusae (enlarged superficial periumbilical veins)

#### RENAL FUNCTION

In cirrhosis there is decreased clearance of immune complexes so they get trapped in the kidney.

Causes **IgA nephropathy ± hepatic glomerulosclerosis**.

- HCV can cause cryoglobulinaemia ± membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

- HBV may cause membranous nephropathy ± PAN.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis can also occur in alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.


### INVESTIGATIONS

#### BLOODS

**LFTs** - normal, OR

- increased bilirubin
- increased AST
- increased ALT
- increased ALP
- increased gamma-GT

Later, with **loss of synthetic function**, look for:

- decreased albumin
- ± increased PT/INR

Indications of **hyposplenism**:

- decreased WCC
- decreased platelets

Look for the **cause**:

- ferritin
- iron-binding capacity
- hepatits serology
- immunoglobulins
- autoantibodies: 
	- ANA
	- AMA
	- SMA
- alpha-feto protein
- caeruloplasmin in pts <40y
- alpha1-antitrypsin


#### IMAGING

Liver US + duplex may show:

- small liver or hepatomegaly
- splenomegaly
- focal liver lesions
- hepatic vein thrombus
- reversed flow in the portal vein
- ascites

MRI features more common in acoholic cirrhosis than virus-induced cirrhosis:

- increased size of caudate lobe
- smaller islands of regenerating nodules
- presence of R posterior hepatic notch

MRI scoring systems assess spleen volume, liver volume and presence of ascites or varices/collaterals. Quantifies risk in a way that correlates well with Childs grades.

#### OTHER

Ascitic tap should be performed - send fluid for urgent MC&S. Neutrophils >250/mm^3 indicates **spontaneous bacterial peritonitis**.

Liver biopsy confirms clinical diagnosis.

### CLASSIFICATION

Child-Pugh grading of cirrhosis + risk of variceal bleeding.

Variable | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points
--- | --- | --- | ---
bilirubin (micromols/L) | <34 | 34-51 | >51
albumin (g/L) | >35 | 28-35 | <28
prothrombin time (s) | 1-3 | 4-6 | >6
ascites | none | slight | moderate
encephalopathy | none | 1-2 | 3-4

- Grade A = 5-6
- Grade B = 7-9
- Grade C = >10

Risk of variceal bleeding is much higher is score >8.

Can also be used to predict mortality and quantify need for liver transplant.


### MANAGEMENT

- treat cause

- good nutrition

- alcohol abstinence

- avoid NSAIDs, sedatives, opiates

- **colestyramine** for pruritis

- ?US ± alpha-fetoprotein every 3-6/12 to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma

Ascites:

- bed rest
- fluid restriction
- low salt diet
- daily weights
- **spironolactone**
- if unresponsive, add **furosemide**
- may try therapeutic paracentesis w/ concomitant albumin infusion

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis:

- consider in any ascitic pt who suddenly deteriorates
- common organisms
	- E coli
	- Klebsiella
	- Streps
- **cefotaxime**
- or **tazocin**
- **metronidazole** if recent instrumentation to ascites
- prophylaxis for high risk pts or previous episode

### PROGNOSIS

Overall 5yr survival ~50%.

Poor prognostic indicators:

- encephalopathy

- serum Na <110 mmol/L

- serum albumin <25 g/L

- high INR


### TRANSPLANTATION

Liver transplant is the only definitive rx.

Increases 5y survival from ~20% in end-stage disease to ~70%.
