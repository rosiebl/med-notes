# WILSON'S DISEASE

Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder of biliary copper excretion with too much copper in the liver and the CNS (basal ganglia, e.g. globus pallidus hypodensity Â± putamen cavitation).

It is treatable, so all young people with cirrhosis should be screened.

Prevalence: 3/100,000.

### GENETICS

Autosomal recessive disorder.

Gene on chromosome 13 that codes for a copper transporting ATPase: ATP7B.

>200 mutations known.

Commonest mutation in European populations is HIS1069GLU.

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Total boddy copper ~125mg.

Copper intake ~3mg/day, absorbed in proximal small intestine.

In the liver, copper is incorporated into caeruloplasmin.

In Wilson's disease:

- intestinal copper absorption intact
- copper transport into liver intact
- incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin in hepatocytes impaired
- excretion of copper into bile impaired

Thus copper accumulates in the liver, and later in other organs including the CNS.

### SIGNS + SYMPTOMS

Children present with **liver disease**:

- hepatitis

- cirrhosis

- fulminant liver failure

Young adults often initially present with **CNS signs**:

- tremor

- dysarthria

- dysphagia

- dyskinesias

- dystonias

- purposeless stereotyped movements e.g. hand clapping

- dementia

- parkinsonism

- micrographia

- ataxia/clumsiness

**Mood**:

- depression/mania

- labile emotions

- high or low libido

- personality change

**Cognition**:

- loss of memory

- quick to anger

- slow to solve problems

- decreased IQ

- delusions

- mutism

**Kayer-Fleischer rings**: copper in iris. Not invariable.

Other signs:

- haemolysis

- blue lunulae (nails)

- arthritis

- hypermobile joints

- grey skin

### INVESTIGATIONS

**Urine**: 24h copper excretion high, e.g. >100ug/24h.

**LFTs**: raised, non-specific (but ALT >1500 not part of picture).

**Serum copper**: typically <11umol/L.

**Serum caeruloplasmin**: low, <200mg/L. <140mg/L = pathognomonic.

- falsely low caeruloplasmin: protein-deficiency states, any chronic liver disease can cause decreased synthesis
- falsely high caeruloplasmin: acute phase reactant so sometimes high in inflammation/infection + pregnancy

**Molecular genetic testing**:  can confirm dx.

**Slit lamp exam: KF rings**. In iris/Descemet's membrane.

**Liver biopsy**: high hepatic copper; hepatitis; cirrhosis.

**MRI**: degeneration in basal ganglia, fronto-temporal, cerebellar or brainstem.

### MGMT

**Diet**: avoid food with high copper content, e.g. liver, chocolate, nuts, mushrooms, legumes + shellfish.

Lifelong **penicillamine**: 

- 500mg/6-8h PO for 1y

- maintenance 0.75-1g/d

- SE:

	- nausea

	- rash

	- low WCC

	- low Hb

	- low platelets

	- haematuria

	- nephrosis

	- lupus

- monitor FBC + urinary Cu + protein excretion

- pt should report sore throat, high temp or bruising immediately, 
in case of low WCC or platelets

- stop if WCC <2.5 or platelets falling

Alternative drug: **trientine dihydrochloride** 600mg/6-12h PO. SE rash, sideroblastic anaemia.

**Liver transplantation** if severe liver disease.

Screen siblings as asymptomatic homozygotes need treating.

### PROGNOSIS

Pre-cirrhotic liver disease is reversible; CNS damage less so.

No clear clinical prognostic indicators.

Fatal events:

- liver failure
- bleeding
- infection
