# PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS

Primary sclerosing cholangitis entails progressive cholestasis with bile duct inflammation and strictures.

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

Pruritis Â± fatigue.

Advanced disease:

- ascending cholangitis

- cirrhosis

- end-stage hepatic failure

### ASSOCIATIONS

- female

- HLA-A1; B8; DR3

- autoimmune hepatitis

- IBD

	- 80% + northern European pts also have IBD

	- usually UC of whole colon

	- IBD often presents before PSC

	- **typically inactive colitis, but paradoxically increased risk of malignancy**

### CANCERS

Cancers more common in PSC:

- bile duct
- gallbladder
- liver
- colon

Do yearly colonoscopy + ultrasound.

Consider cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps.

### INVESTIGATIONS

Bloods:

- ALP raised

- bilirubin riased (later)

- hypergammaglobulinaemia

- AMA -ve

- ANA, SMA + ANCA may be +ve

ERCP distinguishes large duct from small duct disease.

Liver biopsy: fibrous, obliterative cholangitis.

### MGMT

Liver transplant for end-stage disease.

- recurrence in up to 30%.

- 5yr graft survival 60%.

- prognosis worse for those with IBD as 5-10% develop colorectal cancer post-transplant.

**Ursodeoxycholic acid**: may protect against colon cancer + improve LFT. High doses may be harmful.

**Colestyramine** 4-8g/24h PO for pruritis (**naltrexone** + **rifampicin** may help).

**Abx** for bacterial cholangitis.
