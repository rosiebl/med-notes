# ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME

Acute coronary syndrome refers to a spectrum of acute myocardial ischaemia and/or infarction.

ACS is usually divded into: 

- **ACS with ST-segment elevation or new osnet LBBB** (what people mean by acute MI)
- **ACS without ST-segment elevation** (including unstable angina and NSTEMI)

Unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are a continuum of pathology, mainly differentiated by the presence of markers of myocardial damage.

**Common underlying pathology** in ACS: plaque rupture, thrombosis and inflammation.

Rarely be due to emboli, coronary spasm in normal arteries or vasculitis.

**Incidence** 5/1000 per annum (UK) for ST-segment elevation.

### RISK FACTORS

Non-modifiable:

- age
- male gender
- family hx of IHD
	- MI in 1st degree relative <55y

Modifiable:

- smoking
- HTN
- DM
- hyperlipidaemia
- obesity
- sedentary lifestyle
- cocaine use

?risk factors:

- stress
- 'type A' personality
- LVH
- high fibrinogen
- hyperinsulinaemia
- high homocysteine levels
- ACE genotype


### DX

Acute MI defined by several criteria:

- increase and then decrease in cardiac biomarkers e.g. troponin

AND, any of:

- symptoms of ischaemia
- ECG changes of new ischaemia
- development of pathological Q waves
- loss of myocardium on imaging


#### DDX

- angina
- pericarditis
- myocarditis
- aortic dissection
- pulmonary embolism
- oesophageal reflux/spasm

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

Main symptom is **acute central chest pain** lasting >20mins, often associated with:

- nausea
- sweatiness
- dyspnoea
- palpitations

May present w/o pain as a **'silent infarct'**, e.g. in elderly, diabetics. These presentaitons may include:

- syncope
- pulmonary oedema
- epigastric pain and vomiting
- post-operative hypotension or oliguria
- acute confusional state
- stroke
- diabetic hyperglycaemic states

Signs:

- distress

- anxiety

- pallor

- sweatiness

- tachy- or bradycardia

- hypertension

- 4th heart sound

- signs of heart failure: raised JVP, 3rd heart sound, basal creps

- pansystolic murmur: papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture, VSD

- low-grade fever

- later:
	- pericardial friction rub
	- peripheral oedema


### INVESTIGATIONS

#### ECG

Within hours of transmural infarction:

- hyperacute tall T waves
- ST elevation
- new LBBB

Over hours to days:

- T wave inversion
- pathological Q waves

In other ACS:

- ST depression
- T wave inversion
- non-specific changes
- or normal

In 20% of MI ECG may initially be normal.

#### CXR

Look for:

- cardiomegaly
- pulmonary oedema
- widened mediastinum (aortic rupture)

Don't delay rx for a CXR.

#### BLOODS

FBC, U&E, glucose, lipids.

##### CARDIAC ENZYMES

Cardiac troponin levels (T + I):

- most sensitive + specific markers of myocardial necrosis
- serum levels increase in 3-12h from onset of chest pain
- peak at 24-48h
- decrease to baseline over 5-14d
- if normal >6h after onset of pain + ECG normal, risk of missing MI tiny

Creatine kinase:

- 3 isoenzymes: 
	- CK-MM: mostly in skeletal muscle, high after trauma, exercise, myositis, hypothyroidism, in African-Caribbeans people
	- CK-BB: mostly in brain
	- CK-MB: mostly in heart
- CK-MB levels increase in 3-12h after onset of chest pain
- peak within 24h
- return to baseline after 48-72h
- earlier peak if reperfusion
- sensitivity 95% + high specificity

Myoglobin:

- levels increase within 1-4h from onset of pain
- highly sensitive
- not specific


### MGMT

See other notes for mgmt.


### PROGNOSIS

50% of deaths occur within 2h of onset of symptoms.

Up to 7% die before discharge.

Worse prognosis if:

- elderly
- LV failure
- ST changes

NSTEMI overall risk of death ~1-2% but 15% for refractory angina despite medical rx.

Increase risk if:

- hx of unstable angina
- ST depression or widespread T-wave inversion
- raised troponin (except pts with STEMI)
- age >70
- general comorbidity, previous MI, poor LV function or DM
