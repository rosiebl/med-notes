# HYPERTENSION

Major risk factor for stroke and MI. Causes ~50% of all vascular deaths.

Usually asymptomatic so screening crucial.

BP on a normal distribution in population so choose cut off over which risk is significantly increased and benefit of treatment is clear.

### TYPES OF HTN 

Normotensive = ABPM <135/80mmHg

Stage 1 HTN = ABPM >135/85mmHg

Stage 2 HTN = ABPM >150/95mmHg

Isolated systolic HTN:

- most common form in UK
- over 50% over-60s
- from arteriosclerosis
- 2x risk of MI
- 3x risk of CVA

Malignant/accelerated phase HTN

- rapid rise in BP causing vascular damage
- pathology: fibrinoid necrosis
- severe HTN + bilateral retinal haemorrhages, +/- papilloedema
- symptoms common: headache, visual disturbance
- urgent treatment needed
- may precipitate hypertensive emergencies e.g. acute renal failure, heart failure, encephalopathy
- more common in young pts + black pts
- look for underlying cause

Essential/primary hypertension: no known cause (although there are a number of known risk factors such as smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity etc.). 

Secondary hypertension is hypertension as a result of disease. ~5% cases. Causes are:

—> Renal

- most common
- intrinsic renal disease: 75%
	- glomerulonephritis
	- polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
	- systemic sclerosis
	- chronic pyelonephritis
	- polycystic kidney
- renovascular disease: 25%
	- atheromatous
	- fibrmuscular dysplasia

—> Endocrine

- Cushing's
- Conn's
- phaeochromocytoma
- acromegaly
- hyperparathyroidism

—> Coarctation

—> Pregnancy

—> Steroids

—> Contraceptive pill

—> MAOI

### DIAGNOSIS

If BP measured in clinic is >140/90 then do ambulatory BP monitoring.

While waiting for ABPM, test for target organ damage.

Tests for target organ damage:

- proteinuria: urine sample to lab
- haematuria: urine dipstick
- bloods:
	- glucose
	- U&E
	- calcium
	- creatinine
	- eGFR
	- serum total cholesterol
	- HDL
- ECG

Also assess CVD risk using a validated measure like Q Risk.

Grades of hypertensive retinopathy:

	I. Tortuous arteries with thick shiny walls (silver or copper wiring)
	II. A-V nipping (narrowing where arteries cross veins)
	III. Flame haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots
	IV. Papilloedema


Refer immediately to a specialist if:
	- accelerated HTN: BP >180/110 with signs of papilloedema and/or retinal haemorrhage
	- suspected phaeochromocytoma

### INITIATING TREATMENT AND AIMS

Offer antihypertensive treatment to:

—> people <80yo with Stage 1 HTN and:

- target organ damage
- known CVD
- renal disease
- diabetes
- 10y CVD risk >20%

—> anyone with Stage 2 HTN


In <80yo, aim for BP <140/90.

In >80yo, aim for BP <150/90.

In diabetic, aim for BP <130/80.

### LIFESTYLE

Patients with HTN can change their lifestyle to reduce their BP (modifiable risk factors), e.g.:
	
- low-fat balanced diet
- reduce salt intake <6g/d
- exercise
- decrease alcohol intake
- decrease caffeine intake
- stop smoking
- sleep at least 6h/night
- relaxation techniques


Group work can be helpful with this.
