# ARRHYTHMIAS

Cardiac arrhythmia is a disturbance in the rate of cardiac muscle contractions, or any variation from the normal rhythm or rate of heart beat.


### CLASSIFICATION

Arrhythmias can be classified in various ways, including site, mechanism, rate and by ECG.

Site of origin:

- atrial
- supraventricular
- ventricular

Mechanism of disturbance:

- fibrillation
- automaticity
- re-entry
- triggered activity

Rate of disturbance:

- bradycardia
- tachycardia

ECG appearance:

- narrow complex
- broad complex

### CAUSES

Cardiac:

- MI

- coronary artery disease

- LV aneurysm

- mitral valve disease

- cardiomyopathy

- pericarditis

- myocarditis

- aberrant conduction pathways

Non-cardiac:

- caffeine
- smoking
- alcohol
- pneumonia
- drugs
	- B2-agonists
	- digoxin
	- L-dopa
	- tricyclics
	- doxorubicin
- metabolic imbalance
	- K+
	- Ca2+
	- Mg2+
	- hypoxia
	- hypercapnia
	- metabolic acidosis
	- thyroid disease
- phaeochromocytoma

### PRESENTATION

- palpitations

- chest pain

- presyncope/syncope

- hypotension

- pulmonary oedema

Some arrhythmias may be asymptomatic and incidental, e.g. AF.

Rememebr to ask about: 

- precipitating factors
- onset/offset
- duration
- associated symptoms (see above)
- DHx
- PMHx
- FHx of cardiac disease 

### INVESTIGATIONS

Bloods:

- FBC
- U&E
- glucose
- Ca2+
- Mg2+
- TSH

**--> ECG**

- signs of ischaemic heart disease
- AF
- short PR interval
- long QT interval
- U waves

24h ECG monitoring - may need several recordings.

Echo: any structural heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

May need provocation tests:

- exercise ECG
- cardiac catheterisation Â± electrophysiological studies


### MGMT

If ECG normal during palpitations, can reassure pt.

Otherwise treatment specific to arrhythmia (see notes).
