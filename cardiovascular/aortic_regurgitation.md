# AORTIC REGURGITATION

Aortic regurgitation is the diastolic leakage of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle. 

It happens because of inadequate closure of valve leaflets due to intrinsic valve disease or dilation of the aortic root.

Can be asymptomatic for decades before patients present with irreversible myocardial damage.

### CAUSES

#### ACUTE

- infective endocarditis

- ascending aortic dissection

- chest trauma

#### CHRONIC

- congenital

- connective tissue disorders e.g. Marfans, Ehlers-Danlos

- rheumatic fever

- Takayasu arteritis

- rheumatoid arthritis

- SLE

- pseudoxanthoma elasticum

- appetite suppressants e.g. fenfluramine, phentermine

- seronegatives arthritides e.g. ank spond, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis

- HTN

- osteogenesis imperfecta

- syphilitic aortitis

### SYMPTOMS

- exertional dyspnoea

- orthopnoea

- paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea

Also:

- palpitaitons

- angina

- syncope

- congestive cardiac failure

### SIGNS

- pulse: collapsing pulse, wide pulse pressure

- apex beat: displaced, hyperdynamic 

- murmur: high-pitched, **early diastolic murmur** (heard best sitting forward + expiration)

#### EPONYMOUS SIGNS

Corrigan's sign: carotid pulsation

de Musset's sign: head nodding with each heartbeat

Quincke's sign: capillary pulsations in nailbeds

Duroziez's sign: groin compression of femoral artery 2cm proximal to sethoscope gives systolic murmur; 2cm distal gives diastolic

Traube's sign: 'pistol shot' sound over femoral arteries

Austin Flint murmur: denotes severe AR.

### INVESTIGATIONS

##### ECG

LVH

##### CXR

- cardiomegaly
- dilated ascending aorta
- pulmonary oedema

##### ECHO

Diagnostic.

##### CARDIAC CATHETER

To assess:

- severity of lesion
- anatomy of aortic root
- LV function
- coronary artery disease
- other valve disease

### MANAGEMENT

Main goal is to reduce systolic HTN.

**ACE inhibitors** helpful.

**Echo** every 6-12/12 to monitor.

Aim to **replace valve** before significant LV dysfunction occurs.

Indications for **surgery**:

- increasing symptoms
- enlarging heart on CXR/echo
- ECG deterioration (T-wave inversion in lateral leads)
- IE refractory to medical rx


Predictors of poor post-op outcome:

- ejection fraction <50%
- NYHA class III or IV
- duration of congestive cardiac failure >12 months
