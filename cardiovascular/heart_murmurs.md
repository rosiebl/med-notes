# HEART MURMURS

DEFECT | MURMUR | LOCATION
--- | --- | ---
mitral regurgitation | pansystolic | apex radiating to axilla
mitral stenosis | end diastolic | mitral area
mitral valve prolapse | late systolic murmur and/or midsystolic click | mitral area
aortic stenosis | ejection systolic | aortic area, can sometimes be heard throughout, radiates to carotids
aortic regurgitation | early diastolic murmu | aortic area, heard best sitting forward on inspiration
tricuspid regurgitation | pansystolic murmur | lower sternal edge on inspiration
tricuspid stenosis | early diastolic murmur | L sternal edge on inspiration
pulmonary stenosis | ejection systolic murmur | pulmonary area, radiates to L shoulder
