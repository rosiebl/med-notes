# NARROW COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA

Narrow complex tachycardia is defined by ECG findings of:

- rate >100 bpm
- QRS complex duration of <120ms

### DIFFERENTIAL DX

- sinus tachycardia

- supraventricular tachycardia

- atrial fibrillation

- atrial flutter

- atrial tachycardia

- multifocal atrial tachycardia

- junctional tachycardia

### PRINCIPLES OF MGMT

If the pt is compromised, use **DC cardioversion**.

Otherwise, **identify the underlying rhythm** and treat accordingly.

**Vagal manouevres** e.g. carotid sinus msasage, Valsalva manouevre, transiently increase AV block, so may unmask an underlying atrial rhythm.

If unsuccessful can give **adenosine** which causes transient AV block:

- transiently slows ventricles to show underlying atrial rhythm
- cardioverts a junctional tachcardia to sinus rhythm
- slow half life - 10-15s

#### ADENOSINE USE

Adenosine 6mg IV bolus into big vein.

Follow with saline fluch while recording rhythm strip.

If unsuccessful, after 1-2 mins give 12mg, then 12mg again.

If on dipyridamole or post-cardiac transplatation change dose.

Side effects:

- transient chest tightness
- dyspnoea
- headache
- flushing

Contraindications:

- asthma
- 2nd/3rd degree AV block
- sinoatrial disease, unless pacemaker

Drug interactions:

- potentiated by dipyridamole
- antagonsied by theophylline

Transplanted hearts v sensitive: give lower dose.


### SPECIFIC NARROW COMPLEX TACHYCARDIAS

#### SINUS TACHYCARDIA

Normal P wave followed by normal QRS.

Mgmt: identify and treat the cause.

#### SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA

P wave absent or inverted after QRS.

	vagal manouevres if haemodynamically stable
	~
	IV adenosine
	~
	if fails: verapamil 5mg IV over 2min, further dose if no response (not if on B-blocker)
	~
	alternatives: atenolol or sotalol
	~
	if fails: DC cardioversion
	~
	maintenance rx: B-blockers or verapamil

#### ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

Absent P wave, irregular QRS complexes.

[See other notes for mgmt.]

#### ATRIAL FLUTTER

Atrial rate usually 300bpm giving 'flutter waves' or 'swtooth' baseline.

Ventricular rate often 150bpm: 2:1 block.

[See other notes for mgmt.]

#### ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA

Abnormally shaped P waves, may outnumber QRS.

Rare, may be due to digoxin toxicity.

	if due to digoxin, stop.
	~
	maintain K+ at 4-5mmol/L.

#### MULTIFOCAL ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA

3 or more P wave morphologies, irregular QRS complexes.

Most commonly occurs in COPD.

	correct hypoxia and hypercapnia.
	~
	if rate remains >110bpm: verapamil or B-blocker 

#### JUNCTIONAL TACHYCARDIA

3 types of junctional tachycardia:

- AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT)
- AV re-entry tachcardia (AVRT)
- His bundle tachycardia

Rate 150-250bpm.

P wave either buried in QRS complex or occurring after QRS complex.

	if anterograde conduction through the AV node: try vagal manouevres
	~
	adenosine usually converts to sinus rhythm
	~
	recurrence: B-blocker or amiodarone
	~
	AVRT + symptomatic AVNRT: radiofrequency ablation


#### WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE SYNDROME

Caused by congenital atrioventricular accessory conduction pathway.

Resting ECG:

- short Pr interval
- wide QRS complex - due to slurred upstroke/delta wave
- ST-T changes

2 types: 

- WPW A: +ve delta wave in V1
- WPW B: -ve delta wave in V1

Present with SVT which may be due to an AVRT, pre-excited AF or pre-excited atrial flutter.

Refer to cardio for electrophysiology + ablation of accessory pathway.
