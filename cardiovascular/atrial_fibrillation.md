# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

Atrial fibrillation is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm at 300-600bmp. The AV node responds intermittently so there is an irregular fast ventricular rate.

Cardiac output drops by 10-20% as the ventricles aren't primed reliably by the atria.

Common in ederly: ~9%.

Main risk: embolic stroke. Warfarin reduces stroke risk to 1%/yr from 4%.

### CAUSES

Common causes:

- heart failure/ischaemia

- hypertension

- MI (seen in 22%)

- PE

- mitral valve disease

- pneumonia

- hyperthyroidism

- caffeine

- alcohol

- post-op

- hypokalaemia

- low magnesium

Rare causes:

- cardiomyopathy

- constrictive pericarditis

- sick sinus syndrome

- lung cancer

- atrial myxoma

- endocarditis

- haemochromatosis

- sarcoid

Lone AF: no cause found.

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

May be asymptomatic or cause:

- chest pain
- palpitations
- dyspnoea
- faintness

Signs:

- **irregularly irregular pulse**
- apical pulse rate greater than radial rate
- 1st heart sound often of variable intensity
- signs of LVF

Examine whole pt as AF often associated with non-cardiac disease.

### INVESTIGATIONS

ECG:

- absent P waves
- irregular QRS complexes

Bloods:

- U&E
- cardiac enzymes
- thyroid function tests

Consider echo to look for:

- L atrial enlargement
- mitral vlve disease
- poor LV function
- other structural abnormalities

### MGMT ACUTE AF

Very ill or haemodynamically unstable:

	O2
	U&E
	~
	emergency cardioversion
	
	if unavailable IV amiodarone
	~
	treat associated illnesses
	~
	control ventricular rate: 
	
	1st line verapamil or bisoprolol
	2nd line digoxin or amiodarone
	~
	start full anticoagulation: LMWH

If 48h window has run out, cardioversion OK if transoesophageal ech thrombus-free.
	
#### CARDIOVERSION REGIME

	O2
	~
	ITU/CCU
	~
	GA or IV sedation, monophasic
	~
	200J
	~
	360J
	~
	360J (biphasic; 200J)

Relapses back into AF common.

#### DRUG CARDIOVERSION

Often preferred.

	amiodarone IVI (25h) or PO (2 weeks + maintenance)
	
	OR
	
	flecainide (10-30 mins) if stable + no known IHD/WPW

### MGMT CHRONIC AF

Main goals in managing permanent AF are **rate control** and **anticoagulation**.

Rate control is at least as good as rhythm control but rhythm control may be appropriate if:

- symptomatic or CCF
- younger pt
- presenting for 1st time with lone AF
- AF from a corrected precipitant, e.g. derangement of U&Es.

#### RATE CONTROL

	B-blocker or rate-limiting cacium channel blocker
	~
	if fails, add digoxin
	~
	then consider amiodarone

Digoxin as monotherapy in AF only OK in sedentary pts.

#### RHYTHM CONTROL

If cardioversion chosen, do echo 1st.

Pre-treat for >4 weeks with **sotolol** or **amiodarone** if there is high risk of failure (e.g. past fialure or recurrence).

Pharmacological conversion:

- **flecainide** 1st choice if no structural heart disease
- IV **amiodarone** if structural heart disease

Other options:

- AV node ablation
- maze procedure
- pacing
- pulmonary vein ablation

#### PAROXYSMAL AF

'Pill in pocket' e.g. **sotalol** or **flecainide** PRN.

Try if:

- infrequent AF
- BP >100 mmHg systolic
- no past LV dysfunction

Anticoagulate.

#### ANTICOAGULATION

In acute AF:

- LMWH until full emboli risk assessment made

- warfarin if risk is high

- no anticolagulation if stable sinus rhythm restored AND no risk factors for emboli AND risk of recurrence low

Chronic AF:

- anticoagulate with warfarin

- less effective alternative: aspirin ~300mg/d PO e.g. if warfarin contraindicated

**Target INR in AF**:

- target 2.5
- range 2-3

##### CHA2DS2-VASc SCORE

Risk of emboli is calculated using the CHA2DS2-VASc score.

**C**: congestive heart failure, or LV systolic dysfunction (1)

**H**: hypertension >140/90 or on medication (1)

**A2**: age >75 (2)

**D**: diabetes mellitus (1)

**S2**: prior stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2)

**V**: vascular disease e.g. peripheral artery disease, MI, aortic plaque (1)

**A**: age 65-74 (1)

**Sc**: sex category, i.e. female (1).

Annual stroke risk:

CHA2DS2-VASc score | Stroke risk %
-- | --
0 | 0
1 | 1.3
2 | 2.2
3 | 3.2
4 | 4.0
5 | 6.7
6 | 9.8
7 | 9.6
8 | 12.5
9 | 15.2

Treatment guidelines based on the scoring system:

Score | Risk | Anticoagulation rx
-- | -- | --
0 (male) or 1 (female) | low | no anticoagulant rx
1 (male) | moderate | consider anticoagulant rx
2 or greater | high | oral anticoagulation recommended


# ATRIAL FLUTTER

Continuous atrial depolarisation, e.g. 300min, but v variable, produces a sawtooth baseline Â± 2:1 AV block.

Carotid sinus massage and IV ademosine transiently block the AV node and may unmask flutter waves.

### MGMT

Cardioversion may be indicated.

Anti-atrial fibrillation drugs may not work, but consider:

- **amiodarone** to restore sinus rhythm

- **amiodarone** or **sotolol** to maintain 

Aim to control rate as in atrial fibrillation. If IV route is needed, a B-blocker is preferred.

Rarely, perform cavotricuspid isthmus ablation.
