# BROAD COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA

Narrow complex tachycardia is defined by ECG findings of:

- rate >100 bpm
- QRS complex duration of >120ms (>3 small squares)

If no clear QRS compelxes, it is VF or asystole.


### DIFFERENTIAL DX

- ventricular tachycardia, including torsade de pointes
- 
- supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction, e.g. AF, flutter

### PRINCIPLES OF MGMT

Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly (see below).

If in doubt, treat as VT, the commonest cause.

### RHYTHM IDENTIFICATION

Dx based on hx, 12-lead ECG and lack of response to IV adenosine.

ECG findings in favour of VT:

- positive QRS concordance in chest leads
	- QRS complexes all positive
- marked left axis deviation
- AV dissociation (occurs in 25%) or 2:1 or 3:1 AV block.
- fusion beats
	- normal beat fuses with VT complex to create an unusual complex
- capture beats
	- normal QRS between abnormal beats

Bear in mind the QRS Brugada criteria.

### SPECIFIC BROAD COMPLEX TACHYCARDIAS

#### VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION + PULSELESS/UNSTABLE VT

Use asynchronised DC shock - see the European Resuscitation Guidelines.

#### STABLE VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA

	high flow O2 via face mask
	~
	IV access: U&E, Ca, Mg
	correct low K or Mg
	~
	12-lead ECG
	~
	ABG if evidence of pulmonary oedema, reduced conscious level, sepsis
	~
	amiodarone IVI
	[rarely lidocaine instead]
	~
	if torsade de pointes, magnesium sulphate 2g over 5mins
	~
	after VT correction establish cause from hx/investigations
	~
	may need maintenance rx e.g. amiodarone
	~
	prevention of recurrence: automatic defibrillator implant.
	~
	refractory cases: radiofrequency ventricular tachycardia ablation

##### TORSADE DE POINTES

Looks like VF but is VT with varying axis.

Due to increased QT interval - SE of antiarrhythmics s consider stopping.

	magnesium sulphate 2g IV over 10min Â± overdirve pacing

#### VENTRICULAR EXTRASYSTOLES/ECTOPICS

Commonest post-MI arrhythmia. Suggest electrical instability.

Also seen in health.

Risk is VF is R on T pattern seen.

	if >10/min consider IV amiodarone

Otherwise just observe.
