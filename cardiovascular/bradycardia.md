# BRADYCARDIA

Bradycardia is any heart rate slower than 50 bpm, even if transient, caused by sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.

### CAUSES

Bradycardia is due to sinus node dysfunction or conduction system disease.

Intrinsic causes:

- degenerative

- congenital

- direct tissue damage e.g. inferior wall MI

- tissue inflammation or infiltration

- infections

- abnormal autonomic effects

- increased intracranial pressure


Extrinsic causes:

- toxins e.g. lead, tricyclic antidepressant overdose

- drugs e.g. digoxin, B-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, some antiarrhythmics

- electrolyte abnormalities

Some causes reversible.

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS

Heart rate <50 bpm.

Pt may be asymptomatic, or experience:

- syncope

- fatigue

- dizziness

Also SOB/exercise intolerant.

### MGMT

**Asymptomatic + rate >40**: no treatment required.

	Look for a cause + stop any contributing drugs.

**Symptomatic or rate <40**:

	atropine - 0.6-1.2mg IV
	~
	if fails: temporary pacing wire
	~
	if fails: isoprenaline infusion or external cardiac pacing
	
### SICK SINUS SYNDROME

Sinus node dysfunction can cause:

- bradycardia Â± arrest
- sinoatrial block
- tachy-brady syndrome: SVT alternating with bradycardia/asystole

AF + thromboembolism can occur.

Pace if symptomatic.
