# ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK

AV block is a cardiac electrical disorder defined as impaired conduction from the atria to the ventricles.

Severity is described in degrees:

- First degree AV block
- Second degree AV block
	- Type I: Wenckeback or Mobitz I
	- Type II: Mobitz II
- Third degree (complete) AV block

This classification only applies during sinus rhythm, not during rapid atrial arrhythmias or to premature atrial beats.

### CAUSES

Common causes:

- fibrosis + calcification of the conduction system

- coronary artery disease, incl. chronic conditions + ACS

- medication, e.g.
	
	- AV-nodal blocking agents
		- B-blockers
		- calcium-channel blockers
		- digitalis
		- adenosine
	- anti-arrhythmic drugs
		- sodium channel blockers
		- some class III agents e.g. sotalol, amiodarone
		
Other causes:

- high vagal tone

- cardiomyopathy, e.g. hypertrophic, sarcoid, amyloid, haemochromatosis

- calcification fron adjacent vavlular calcification

- post catheter ablation for arrhythmia

- post-surgical e.g. valve repair

- severe electrolyte disturbance

- acidosis

- hypoxaemia

- neuromuscular disorders e.g. myotonic dystrophy

- myocarditis

- infective endocarditis

- Lyme disease

- congenital

### SYMPTOMS + SIGNS	

- heart rate <40 (common)

- syncope

- palpitations

- fatigue

- dyspnoea

- chest pain

Pt may be asymptomatic.

### INVESTIGATIONS

12 lead ECG.

Bloods:

- U&E
- calcium
- cardiac enzymes
- pH
- digitalis level?
- Lyme disease serology?

Others:
- CXR
- transthoracic echocardiogram.
- coronary angiography

### ECG FINDINGS

#### 1st DEGREE AV BLOCK

- Long PR interval

PR interval > 200ms (five small squares).

‘Marked’ first degree block if PR interval > 300ms.

#### 2nd DEGREE AV BLOCK, MOBITZ TYPE I

- Progressive prolongation of the PR interval culminating in a non-conducted P wave - a "dropped beat".

PR interval is longest immediately before the dropped beat

PR interval is shortest immediately after the dropped beat

#### 2nd DEGREE AV BLOCK, MOBITZ TYPE II

- Intermittent non-conducted P waves (dropped beats) **without** progressive prolongation of the PR interval (c.f. Mobitz I).

The PR interval in the conducted beats remains constant: P waves ‘march through’ at a constant rate.

The RR interval surrounding the dropped beat(s) is an exact multiple of the preceding RR interval (e.g. double the preceding RR interval for a single dropped beat, treble for two dropped beats, etc).

#### 2nd DEGREE AV BLOCK WITH FIXED INTERVALS

- Second degree heart block with a fixed ratio of P waves: QRS complexes, e.g. 2:1, 3:1, 4:1.

Can be seen in Mobitz I + II.

#### 2nd DEGREE HIGH-GRADE AV BLOCK

- Second degree heart block with a P:QRS ratio of 3:1 or higher, producing an extremely slow ventricular rate.

Unlike 3rd degree heart block there is still some relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes.

Can be seen in Mobitz I + II.

#### 3rd DEGREE AV BLOCK

- P and QRS not related to each other.

In complete heart block, there is complete absence of AV conduction – none of the supraventricular impulses are conducted to the ventricles.

Perfusing rhythm is maintained by a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm. 

Alternatively, the patient may suffer ventricular standstill leading to syncope (if self-terminating) or sudden cardiac death (if prolonged).

Typically the patient will have severe bradycardia with independent atrial and ventricular rates, i.e. **AV dissociation**.

### MGMT

1st degree or type I 2nd degree AV block:

	aymptomatic: monitor
	~
	symptomatic
	
	1st: discontinue AV blocking drugs
	
	2nd: permanent pacemaker or cardiac resynchronisation rx ± implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement

Type II 2nd degree or 3rd degree AV block:

	aymptomatic/mild-moderate symptoms: 
	
	1st: condition specific mgmt + discontinue AV blocking drugs
	
	2nd: permanent pacemaker or cardiac resynchronisation rx ± implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement
	~
	severely symptomatic: as above but also consider temporary pacing in 1st line mgmt
