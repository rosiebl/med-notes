# SVC OBSTRUCTION

SVC syndrome is a clinical condition which occurs as a result of obstruction of the superior vena cava. 

This **interrupts venous return** from the **head**, **thorax** and **upper extremities** to the R atrium.

**Increased venous pressure** causes oedema of the head, neck and upper limbs. There is often also cyanosis, plethora, and distended subcutaenous vessles. 

Can be caused by intraluminal obstruction or extrinsic compression.

SVC obstruction is not an **emergency** uness there is **trachea compression with airway compromise**.

Otherwise there is usually time to plan optimal rx rather than rushing.

### CAUSES

**90% malignancy; 75% lung cancer.**

Rare causes:

- mediastinal enlargement e.g. germ cell tumour

- thymus malignancy

- mediastinal lymphadenopathy e.g. lymphoma

- thrombotic disorders e.g. Behcet's or nephrotic syndromes

- thrombus around IV central line

- hamartoma

[Hamartoma: benign tumourlike nodule composed of an overgrowth of mature cells/tissues normally present in the affected part, often with one dominant element.]


### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

- dyspnoea

- orthopnoea

- plethora/cyanosis

- swollen face and arm

- cough

- headache

- engorged veins

[Plethora = excess bodily fluid.]

Pemberton's test: lifting arms above head for >1 min causes facial plethora/cyanosis, raised JVP (non-pulsatile), inspiratory stridor.


### INVESTIGATIONS

Urgent contrast-enhanced CT.

### MANAGEMENT

If cause unknown get **tissue dx**, e.g. biopsy peripheral lymph node (bronchoscopy may be hazardous).

Oral **dexamethasone** 8-16mg/24h.

**?balloon venoplasty + SVC stenting**: most rapid symptom relief, e.g. can do before radical/palliative chemo/radiotherapy.
