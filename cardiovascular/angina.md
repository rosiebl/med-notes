# ANGINA PECTORIS

Angina pectoris is central chest tightness or heaviness, brought on by exertion and relieved by rest, and caused by myocardial ischaemia.

**Precipitants**:

- exertion
- mental or emotional stress
- sexual activity
- tachycardia from any cause
- metabolic demands of:
	- severe
	- thyrotoxicosis
	- hypoglycaemia

**Associated symptoms**:

- dyspnoea
- nausea
- sweatiness 
- faintness

### CAUSES

Usually: **atheroma**.

- without coronary collaterals, stenoses of >70% cross sectional area --> angina
- due to **inability to adequately increase coronary blood flow** to meet oxygen demands of exercise
- atherosclerotic disease can also be associated with coronary vasoconstriction - impairs blood flow

Rarely:

- anaemia
- aortic stenosis
- tachyarrhythmias
- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- arteritis/small vessel disease: microvascular angina/cardiac syndrome X

### CLASSIFICATION

**Stable angina**: induced by effort, relieved by rest.

**Unstable (crescendo) angina**: 

- angina of increasing frequency or severity
- occurs on minimal exertion or at rest
- associated with high risk of MI

**Variant (Prinzmetal's) angina**: 

- caused by coronary artery spasm, even in normal arteries
- rare
- may co-exist with fixed stenoses but usually pts don't have the standard risk factors
- ECG during pain shows ST elevation - resolves as pain subsides
- Rx: **calcium channel blockers Â± long-acting nitrates**
	- aspirin can aggravate the ischaemic attacks
	- B blockers can increase vasospasm
- usually good prognosis

### INVESTIGATIONS

ECG is usually normal but may show:

- ST depression
- flat/inverted T waves
- signs of past MI

Exclude precipitating factors (see above).

### MGMT

- **modify risk factors** e.g. smoking, exercise, weight, HTN, diabetes, cholersterol

- **aspirin** 75-150mg/24h reduces mortality

- **B-blockers** reduce symptoms unless contraindicated, e.g. **atenolol** 50-100mg/24h

- **GTN spray**/sublingual tabs: glyceryl trinitrate for symptom control

- **prophylactic nitrates**: regular PO nitrate e.g. **isosorbide mononitrate**, or slow release nitrate e.g. Imdur

- **long-acting calcium antagonists**: **amlodipine** 10mg/24h; **diltiazem-MR** 90-180mg/12h PO - esp useful if contraindication to B-blockers 

- **K channel activator**: **nicorandil** 10-30mg/12h PO if still not controlled

### REFERRAL

Indications for referral:

- diagnostic uncertainty
- new angina of sudden onset
- recurrent angina if past MI or CABG
- angina uncontrlled by drugs
- **unstable angina**

#### PTCA

Precutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty involves balloon dilatation of the stenotic vessels.

Indications:

- poor response to medication
- intolerance to medication
- refractory angina in pts not suitable for CABG
- previous CABG
- post-thrombolysis in pts with severe stenoses
- symptoms
- positive stress tests

Complications: restenosis, emergency CABG.

NICE recommends >70% of angioplasties be accompanied by stenting.
