# MITRAL REGURGITATION

Mitral regurgitation = leakage of the mitral valve making it inefficient due to bidirectional flow. L ventricular contraction ejects blood into the aorta, but also backwards into the L atrium.

### CAUSES

The mitral valve apparatus consists of anterior and posterior leaflets, chordae tendineae, anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles, and mitral annulus. 

Any aberrations of  mitral valve apparatus, due to mechanical, traumatic, infectious, degenerative, congenital, or metabolic causes, may lead to mitral regurgitation (MR).

#### ACUTE

- infective endocarditis

- ischaemic papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture

- ruptured chordae tendinae

- acute rheumatic fever

- acute dilation of the L ventricle due to myocarditis or ischaemia

#### CHRONIC

- acute causes

- myxomatous degeneration of the mitral leaflets/chordae tendinae

- mitral valve prolapse

- mitral annular enlargement

- annular calcification (elderly)

- connective tissue disorders - Ehler’s-Danlos, Marfan’s

- cardiomyopathy

- congenital - can be associated with defects e.g. ASD, AV canal

- appetite suppressants e.g. fenfluramine, phentermine

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Mild to moderate disease can be asymptomatic for many years. 

Severe disease, usually asymptomatic, may last 7-10 years:

- volume overload
- LV eccentric cardiac hypertrophy - elongation of myocardial fibres (see notes)
- increased L ventricular end-diastolic volume
	- compensatory mechanism
	- increase in stroke volume to maintain adequate cardiac output
	- L atrial and ventricular enlargement 
- L atrial dilation due to blood ejected backwards through mitral valve
	- LA and LV enlargement accommodates regurgitant volume at lower filling pressure
	- prevents pulmonary congestion

Severe disease, usually symptomatic:

- L ventricular dysfunction
- increased L ventricular end-systolic diameter
- high L atrial pressure transmitted back to pulmonary circulation
- pulmonary venous hypertension
- pulmonary arterial hypertension
- R ventricular and R atrial hypertrophy and dilatation

### HISTORY

Common:

- dyspnoea
- fatigue
- decreased exercise tolerance
- palpitations
- lower extremity oedema
- infective endocarditis

Uncommon:

- orthopnoea
- paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea
- diaphoresis


### EXAMINATION

- AF

- displaced, hyperdynamic apex beat

- RV heave

- soft S1

- split S2

- loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension)

- **pansystolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla**


### RISK FACTORS

- mitral valve prolapse

- hx of rheumatic heart disease

- infective endocarditis

- hx of cardiac trauma

- hx of MI

- hx of congenital heart disease

- hx of ischaemic heart disease

- L ventricular systolic dysfunction

- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- anorectic/dopaminergic drugs

### INVESTIGATIONS


#### ECG

- non-specific changes
- may show evidence of L atrium enlargement, atrial fibrillation and LV hypertrophy

L atrial enlargement:

- P mitrale (broadening/bifid P wave) in lead II
- biphasic P wave in V1

Increased L atrial pressure can also cause atrial ectopy and AF.

L ventricular hypertrophy in severe mitral incompetence:

- enlargement of the S waves in V1 to V3 
- taller R waves in V4 to V6, I and aVL

Although pulmonary hypertension may later develop in mitral incompetence, normally the ECG shows the features of left ventricular hypertrophy rather than signs of right ventricular hypertrophy.


#### CXR

- big LA and LV
- mitral valve calcification
- pulmonary oedema

#### ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

- to assess LV function and aetiology
- trans-oesophageal to assess severity and suitability for repair rather than replacement

#### DOPPLER ECHO
- to assess size and site of regurgitant jet

#### CARDIAC CATHETERISATION
- confirm dx
- exclude other valve disease
- assess coronary artery disease

### MANAGEMENT

**Control rate** if fast AF.

**Anticoagulate** if: 

- AF
- hx of embolism
- prosthetic valve
- additional mitral stenosis

**Diuretics** improve symptoms.

**Surgery** for deteriorating symptoms: aim to repair or replace valve before LV function irreversibly impaired.
