# MINIMAL CHANGE DISEASE

Minimal change disease is the commonest cause of **nephrotic syndrome** in children (76%).

It can also occur in adults. Causes include:

- idiopathic
- drugs (NSAIDs)
- paraneoplastic, usually Hodgkin's lymphoma

### RENAL BIOPSY

Normal under light microscopy, hence name.

Electron microscopy shows effacement of the podocyte foot processes.

### MGMT

- **steroids**

- frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent disease: **cyclophosphamide** or **ciclosporin/tacrolimus**

Spontaneous remission can occur: implies benefit of steroids is to hold disease until underlying process abates.

### PROGNOSIS

90% children and 70% adults undergo remission with steroids.

~1% --> ESRF.
