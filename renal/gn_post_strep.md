# POST-STREPTOCOCCAL GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Diffuse proliferative GN.

Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is a **diffuse proliferative GN** which occurs **1-12 weeks after a sore throat or skin infection**, due to deposition of a **streptococcal antigen on the glomerulus**, causing a **host reaction** and **immune complex formation**.

Renal biopsy not usually done unless an atypical presentation.

Biopsy shows:

- inflammatory reaction affecting mesangial and endothelial cells
- immunofluorescence: IgG + C3 deposits

Serology:

- high ASOT
- high C3

### MGMT
