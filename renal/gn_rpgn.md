# RAPIDLY-PROGRESSIVE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Aggressive glomerulonephritis which may cause ESRF over days.

There are different categories which all have biopsy findings of crescents affecting most glomeruli.

### CLASSIFICATION

RPGN is classified pathologically into 3 categories with different causes:

- immune complex disease
- pauci-immune disease
- anti-GBM

Immune complex disease (~45%):

- post-infectious
- SLE
- IgA nephropathy/Henoch-Schonlein purpura

Pauci-immune disease (~50%):

- 80-90% ANCA +ve
- granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's): cANCA +ve
- microscopic polyangiitis: pANCA +ve

Anti-GBM disease (~3%):

- Goodpasture's disease


### CLINICAL PRESENTATION

AKI ± systemic features, e.g. fever, myalgia, weight loss, haemoptysis.

Pulmonary haemorrhage is the commonest cause of death in ANCA +ve pts.

### MGMT

Aggressive immunosuppression with:

- high-dose IV steroids 
- cyclophosphamide
- ± plasma exchange

### PROGNOSIS

5 year survival 80%.
