# MEMBRANOUS NEPHROPATHY

Membranous nephropathy is an immunologically mediated disease of the glomerular basement membrane often associated with **nephrotic syndrome**.

One of the most important causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults: accoutns for 2-30% of nephrotic syndrome in adults.

2-5% of nephrotic syndrome in children.

### CAUSES

Mostly idiopathic.

Secondary causes:

- malignancy

- hepatits B

- drugs e.g. gold, penicillamine, NSAIDs

- autoimmunity e.g. thyroid, SLE

### RENAL BIOPSY

Diffusely thickened GBM with IgG + C3 subepithelial deposits on immunofluorescence.

### MGMT

For secondary disease, treat underlying cause.

In primary disease, use general measures for nephrotic syndrome:

- **ACEi/ARB**

- **diuretics**

Trials ongoing into immunosuppressive therapy as up to 80% pts have Abs against phospholipase A2 receptor.

### PROGNOSIS

Spontaneous complete remission in up to 30%.

Partial remission in 24-40% by 5y.
