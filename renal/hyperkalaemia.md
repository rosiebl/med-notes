# HYPERKALAEMIA

### ECG changes

- tall 'tented' T waves

- small or absent P wave

- increased PR interval

- widened QRS complex

- 'sine wave' pattern

- asystole

### MGMT

#### IMMEDIATE RX

**1st line** 

**Calcium gluconate**:

- 10mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV via big vein over 2 mins
- repeat as necessary until ECG improves
- cardioprotective
- doesn't affect K level

**Insulin + glucose**:

- insulin stimulates intracellular uptake of K
- lower serum K by 1-2mmol/L over ~60min

**Other measures**

**Salbutamol nebulisers**:

- stimulates intracellular uptake of K
- high dose requiredL 10-20mg
- tachycardia can limit as may precipitate arrhythmias

**Sodium bicarbonate**:

- can help to drive K into cells if venous bicarbonate low
- unpredictable effect
- IV as infusion or bolus


#### SUBSEQUENT RX

The above measures are temporary and buy time to definitively lower K.

Can be done by:

- **renal clearance**
	- relieve obstruciton with catheter
	- correct pre-renal failure with fluids
- **haemodialysis/filtration**
	- if pt oligoanuric
