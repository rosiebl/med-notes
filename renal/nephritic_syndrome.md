# NEPHRITIC SYNDROME

Nephritic syndrome is characterised by:

1. Haematuria, microscopic or macroscopic

2. Proteinuria ++

3. Hypertension - usually mild

4. Low urine volume <300ml/day

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Nephritic and nephrotic syndrome are somewhat on a spectrum with nephritic being a more advanced form of kidney disease.

The underlying pathology of nephritic and nephrotic syndrome is the same. The main cause of haematuria + proteinuria is injury to the podocyte:

- podocytes wrap around glomerular capillaries

- maintain filtration barrier

- prevent large molecular weight proteins entering the urine

- effacement of foot processes or loss of podocytes --> loss of RBCs and protein

**Nephrotic syndrome:** gaps between podocytes leads to selective proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia as small proteins like albumin are filtered more than large. There is no haematuria as RBCs are too large to leak through the gaps. Hypoalbuminaemia leads to oedema and hyperlipidaemia.

When glomerular damage is more advanced --> **nephritic syndrome**.

	significant glomerular damage - large gaps in podocytes 
	~
	RBC + non-selective protein leak into urine
	~
	--> HAEMATURIA (macro or micro, ?RBC casts)

	--> PROTEINURIA ++
	~
	glomerular damage - reduced renal function
	~
	--> OLIGURIA <300ml/24h
	
	--> HYPERTENSION

There is less proteinuria in nephritic syndrome than in nephrotic, because there is low urine output.


### CAUSES

Primary causes:

- IgA nephropathy

- mesangiocapillary (membranoproliferative) GN (can also present with nephrotic syndrome)

- Henoch-Schonlein purpura


Secondary causes:

- post-streptococcal

- vasculitis (RPGN)

- SLE (classes other than V, which is nephrotic)

- anti-GBM disease (RPGN)

- cryoglobulinaemia
