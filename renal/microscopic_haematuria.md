# MICROSCOPIC HAEMATURIA

Haematuria is classified as visible (macroscopic/frank) or non-visible (microscopic).

Microscopic haematuria is divided into:

- symptomatic microscopic haematuria, i.e. has LUTS symptoms such as dysuria, hesitancy and urgency
- asymptomatic


### AETIOLOGY

Microscopic haematuria (MH) is less commonly associated with malignancy than gross haematuria but may signal cancer.

#### UPPER URINARY TRACT - NON-GLOMERULAR

- infection - pyelonephritis

- nephrolithiasis - stone formation

- mass lesions: range from benign simple renal cysts to malignancy

- abnormalities of vascular inflow, e.g. renal artery infarction/thrombosis, arteriovenous malformations, papillary necrosis

- abnormalities of urine outflow, e.g. hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, ureteropelvic junction obstruction

- polycystic kidney disease

- atrophic kidney

- medullary sponge kidney

#### UPPER URINARY TRACT - GLOMERULAR

Kidney disorders involving the glomerulus, e.g.

- acute glomerulonephritis
- lupus nephritis
- GBM disease
- IgA nephropathy

Can be identified early by RBC morphology and presence of proteinuria.

#### LOWER URINARY TRACT

- infection - cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis

- stone formation

- tumours

- diverticula

- disorders in men w.g. BPH, prostate cancer, phimosis, penis cancer

- bladder neck contracture

- urethreal stricture

#### NON-URINARY TRACT ORIGIN

- menstruation

- trauma - sexual activity, contusion, exercise

- HIV

- lymphoma

- multiple myeloma

- urinary tract tuberculosis

### ASSESSMENT

History: 

- symptoms
- Hx of infection, menses, recent sexual activity, exercise
- FHx of renal disease
- risk factors for urinary tract cancer e.g. tobacco smoking, medications, PMHx, occupational exposures

Bloods:

- FBC
- ESSR
- CRP
- blood film
- clotting
- creatinine/eGFR

Proteinuria: spot ACR of PCR.

Blood pressure.

Urine MC&S to check for infection, malignant/inflammatory cells, casts, crystals.

USS and rapid referal to nephrology if rapid decline in GFR or haematuria with proteinuria, casts or dysmorphic cells.

#### REFERRAL

 Haematuria | Urology | Nephrology
-- | -- | --
Visible haematuria | All pts, any age | <40y, cola-coloured urine, recent infection e.g. URTI
Symptomatic microscopic haematuria | All pts, any age | 
Asymptomatic microscopic haematuria | Persistent, >40y | <40y with BP >140/90, eGFR <60mL/min, ACR >30 or PCR >50
