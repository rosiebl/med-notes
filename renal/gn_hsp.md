# HENOCH-SCHONLEIN PURPURA

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is an IgA-mediated small vessel vasculitis, characterised by the classic tetrad of rash, abdominal pain, arthritis/arthralgia and glomerulonephritis.

HSP is a systemic variant of IgA nephropathy.

Most common vasculitis of childhood.

### FEATURES

Classic tetrad:

1. purpuric rash on extensor surfaces, typically on the legs

2. flitting polyarthritis

3. abdominal pain - GI bleeding

4. nephritis

Dx is usually clinical.

Dx confirmed with positive immunofluorescence for IgA and C3 in skin or renal biopsy (identical to IgA nephropathy).

### MGMT

[Same as IgA nephropathy].

BP control with ACEi.

With nephritic presentation: immunosuppression may slow decline of renal function.

### PROGNOSIS

15% of nephritic pts --> ESRF.

If both nephritic + nephrotic, 50% --> ESRF.
