# GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Glomerulonephritis = inflammation of the glomeruli and nephrons.

- damage to the glomerulus restricts blood flow, leading to compensatory hypertension

- damage to the filtration mechanism allows protein and blood to enter the urine

- loss of the usual filtration capacity leads to AKI


### PRESENTATION

Patients present with a spectrum of disease depending on the degree of inflammation and damage, and the cause.

Many present with specific syndromes.

Syndrome | BP | Urine | GFR
-- | -- | -- | --
nephrotic | normal - mildly raised | proteinuria >3.5g/day | normal - mildly decreased
nephritic | moderately - severely raised | haematuria (mild-macro) | moderately - severely decreased

[See notes on nephrotic and nephritic syndromes].

### CAUSES

[See other notes for individual conditions]

Generally considered to be primary, i.e. no underlying drive to disease, or secondary, to infection, autoimmunity or malignancy.

Tend to present as nephrotic or nephritic.

Syndrome | Common primary causes | Common secondary causes
-- | -- | --
 | | 
Nephrotic | Membranous | Diabetes
 | Minimal change | SLE (class V nephritis)
 | FSGS | Amyloid
 | Mesangiocapillary GN | Hepatitis B/C
 | |
Nephritic | IgA nephropathy | Post-streoptococcal
 | Mesangiocapillary GN | Vasculitis
 |  | SLE (other classes of nephritis)
 |  | Anti-GBM disease
 |  | Cryoglobulinaemia
 
###  INVESTIGATIONS

Look for degree of damage and potential cause.

Bloods:

- FBC
- U&E
- LFT
- ESR
- CRP
- immunoglobulins
- electrophoresis
- complement - C3 and C4
- autoantibodies: ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM
- blood culture
- ASOT
- HBsAg
- anti-HCV

Urine:

- RBC casts
- MC&S
- Bence Jones protein
- ACR

Imaging:

- CXR
- renal ultrasound

Renal biopsy:

- gives most information
- usually reported as:
	- what is affected: mesangial cells, capillaries, basement membrane, endothelium
	- how much of the kidney is involved: focal vs. diffuse
	- how much of glomerulus is involved: segmental vs. global
	- what is seen on immunofluorescence: deposition of Igs, complement, immune complexes or pauci immune
	- elecron microscopy


### GENERAL MGMT

Early referral to a nephrologist.

Keep BP <130/80, or <125/75 if proteinuria >1g/day.

Include and ACEi or ARB - has proven benefits in reducing proteinuria + preserving renal function. (No additional benefit from dual rx).
