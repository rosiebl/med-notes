# RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY: TRANSPLANT

Kidney transplant is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal failure.

Transplant involves major surgery, long-term immunosuppression and various potential complications.

--> Patients must be physically and psychologically suitable.

Anaesthetic assessment is key.

**Absolute contraindications:**

- active infection
- cancer
	- if >5y ago + considered cured, may be considered for transplant
- severe comorbidity

### TYPES OF GRAFT

#### DONOR AFTER CARDIAC DEATH

Donor after cardiac death (DCD): 

- pts who do not meet criteria for brainstem death
- retrieval of organs only begins when cardiac output has ceased

High risk of delayed graft function due to long warm ischaemic time (see below).

#### DONOR AFTER BRAINSTEM DEATH

Donor after brainstem death (DBD):

- patients who meet criteria for brainstem death
- remain on cardiorespiratory support for retrieval

Much reduced risk of delayed graft function.

#### LIVING DONOR

Living donor grafts give much better outcomes:

- planned surgery
- minimal ischaemic time

Can be related or unrelated.

All live donor transplants must be assessed by an Independent Assessor from the Human Tissue Authority before permission can be given to the surgical centre to go ahead.

Involves donor psychological assessment to ensure they understand risks of transplantation.

### IMMUNOSUPPRESSION

#### INDUCTION

Conventional induction with anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody: **basiliximab**.

Many centres now use **alemtuzumab**:

- provides broad immunosuppression
- allows steroid-free maintenance regime
- esp useful in diabetics
- trials ongoing

#### MAINTENANCE

Most pts on triple therapy:

- calcineurin inhibitor (CNIs) e.g. **tacrolimus, ciclosporin**
- antimetabolite e.g. **azathioprine, mycophenolate**
- **prednisolone**

### COMPLICATIONS

Main complications are:

- surgical
- delayed graft function
- rejection
- drug toxicity
- infection
- malignancy
- cardiovascular disease

#### SURGICAL

- bleed

- thrombosis

- infection

- urinary leaks

- lymphocele

- hernia

#### DELAYED GRAFT FUNCTION

Affects up to 40% of grafts.

Far more common in DCD.

Usually acute tubular necrosis in theg raft due to ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

#### REJECTION

Acute or chronic.

**Acute rejection**: humoral or cellular.

- Rx for both: **high dose IV methylprednisolone + intensification of immunosuppression**
- cellular - most common
- humoral - antibody mediated
	- often also requries **plasma exchange** to clear donor-specific Abs

**Chronic rejection**: now known as **chronic allograft nephropathy**.

- combination of:
	- chronic low-grade Ab response
	- vascular changes
	- effects of calcineurin inhibitors
- usually doesn't respond to rx
- progression can be slowed by switching CNI to **sirolimus**

#### DRUG TOXICITY

- neurological: tremor, confusion with CNIs

- new onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT)

- gum hypertrophy, hirsutism: cicolosporin

- agranulocytosis, hepatitis: antimetabolites

#### INFECTION

Increased risk of all infections, particularly opportunists + viral infections due to poor T cell response.

- HSV

- Candida

- Pneumocystis jirovecii

- CMV

#### MALIGNANCY

5x increased risk of cancer with immunosuppression - esp skin and viral-associated.

Women should have regular cervical smears.

EBV associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder particularly problematic.

#### CVD

Leading cause of death in transplant pts.

Probably due to drug effects.

Increased BP in >50% of transplants: proobably partly due to donor vascular diseae in graft, + immunosuppressants.

### PROGNOSIS

Current figures:

- 1y graft survival 91-96%.

- 1y pt survival 96-99%.

- 10y graft survival: 
	
	- 60% DCD
	
	- up to 80% LD.
	
Figures improving year on year.
