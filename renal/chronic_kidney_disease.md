# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

**Chronic kidney disease** is defined as:

	impaired renal function for >3 months based on abnormal structure or function

	OR

	GFR <60mL/min/1.73m^2 for >3 months ± evidence of kidney damage

Classified into 5 stages. Symptoms usually only occur at stage 4.

**End stage renal failure** (ESRF) is defined as:

	GFR <15mL/min/1.73^2

	OR

	need for renal replacement therapy - dialysis or transplant
	
### CLASSIFICATION

Classification of renal impairment in CKD is based on presence of kidney damage and GFR, irrespective of dx.

One reason to classify is to motivate secondary prevention, e.g. to 'mandate' ACEi or ARB if BP >140/85, esp if proteinuria present or stage >3.

Stage | GFR (mL/min) | Notes
-- | -- | --
1 | >90 | normal or raised GFR with other evidence of renal damage
2 | 60-89 | slight decrease in GFR with other evidence of renal damage 
3A | 45-59 | moderate decrease in GFR ± evidence of other renal damage
3B | 30-44 | moderate decrease in GFR ± evidence of other renal damage
4 | 15-29 | severe decrease in GFR ± evidence of renal damage
5 | <15 | established renal failure

N.B. **evidence of other renal damage** is proteinuria, haematuria or evidence of abnormal anatomy or systemic disease.

### CAUSES

- diabetes: 20% in UK, T2DM >> T1DM

- glomerulonephritis: commonly IgA nephropathy, rarer incl mesangiocapillary GN, systemic disorders e.g. SLE, vasculitis

- hypertension

- renovascular disease

- pyelonephritis

- reflux nephropathy: kidney damage caused by backward flow of urine into the kidney

- obstructive uropathy

- chronic interstitial nephritis e.g. myeloma, amyloid

- previous AKI

- adult polycystic kidney disease: commonest inherited cause of CKD

- Alport's syndrome (rare)

- Fabry's disease (rare)


Up to 20% in UK have no obvious cause. Many pts present late with small shrunken kidneys so biopsy would be uninformative.


### SCREENING

Early intervention can reduce progression to ESRF.

Screen at risk pts:

- DM

- HTN

- CVD: IHD, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease

- structural renal disease, known stones or BPH

- recurrent UTIs of childhood hx of vesicoureteric reflux

- multisystem disorders which could involve kidney, e.g. SLE

- FHx of ESRF or known hereditary disease e.g. APKD

- opportunistic detection of haematuria or proteinuria

### ASSESSMENT OF KNOWN/SUSPECTED CKD

#### HX

**Possible cause:**

- previous UTIs

- lower urinary tract symptoms

- PMHx of HTN, IHD, systemic disorder, renal colic

- DHx: nephrotoxic drugs
 
- FHx: genetic causes e.g. polycystic kidney disease
 
- systems review: possible rare causes, anything suggestive of systemic disorder/malignancy

**Current state:**

- oliguria

- dyspnoea

- ankle swelling

- amenorrhoea

- impotence

- uraemic symptoms
	- anorexia

	- vomiting

	- restless legs

	- fatigue

	- weakness

	- pruritis

	- bone pain


#### EXAMINATION AT 1ST PRESENTATION

At 1st presentation, look for:

- pallor

- uraemic yellowish tinge to skin

- purpura

- excoriations

- HTN

- cardiomegaly

- signs of fluid overload

- possible cause e.g. ballotable polycystic kidneys


#### EXAMINATION OF PT WITH KNOWN CKD/ESRF


Looking for:

1. cause of ESRF/CKD, e.g. polycystic kidneys, signs of IHD, DM

2. current mode of RRT and any complications, e.g. transplant + skin malignancy from immunosuppression

3. previous types of RRT + any complications e.g. arteriovenous fistula + parathyroidectomy scar

##### Periphery

- hypertension

- arterionvenous fistula: thrill, bruit, needling

- signs of previous transplant

	- bruising from steroids

	- skin malignancy from immunosuppression

##### Face

- anaemic pallor

- uraemic yellowish tinge

- gum hypertrophy from ciclosporin

- cushingoid appearance from steroids

##### Neck

- scar from parathyroidectomy

- current or previous tunnelled line insertion
	- if removed look for small scar over internal jugular + larger scar in breast pocket area from exit site

##### Abdomen

- ballotable polycystic kidneys ± liver

- PD catheter

- sign of previous catheter: small midline scar just below umbilicus + small round scar to side of midline from exit site

- signs of previous transplant

	- hockey stick scar
	
	- palpable mass

##### Elsewhere

- signs of diabetes

	- neuropathy

	- retinopathy

	- cardiovascular disease

	- peripheral vascular disease	


#### PATIENT IN EXTREMIS

Untreated pts may present in extremis with severe uraemia + hyperkalaemia:

- arrhythmias

- encephalopathy

- seizures

- coma

See notes on hyperkalaemia.

### INVESTIGATIONS

**Bloods:**

- Hb: normochromic, normocytic anaemia

- ESR

- U&E

- glucose (DM)

- hypocalcaemia

- hyperphosphataemia

- high alk phos (renal osteodystrophy)

- high PTH if CKD stage 3+

**Urine:**

- dipstick

- MC&S

- albumin:creatinine ratio, or

- protein: creatinine ratio

**Imaging:** USS to check size, anatomy and corticomedullary differentiation.

- CKD kidneys usually small

- can be enlarged

	- infiltrative disorders e.g. amyloid, myeloma

	- APKD

	- DM

- if asymmetrical consider MAG3 renogram to look at contribution of each kidney to function

**Histology:** consider renal biopsy if rapidly progressive disease or unclear cause + normal sized kidneys (see ntoes on renal biopsy).

#### MONITORING RENAL FUNCTION

**Falling GFR is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease: chief cause of death from renal failure.**

Can plot reciprocal creatinine as a line parallel to falling GFR.

In some pts this will be at a constant rate (straight line), although this isn't always the case so not necessarily that helpful.

Rapid decline in function more than usual may be due to:

- infection
- dehyfration
- uncontrolled HTN
- metabolic disturbance e.g. hypercalcaemia
- obstruction
- nephrotoxins e.g. drugs

Intervention may delay progression to ESRF.

N.B. remember eGFR is only a screening test and may underestimate renal function, esp in mild renal impairment.

eGFR variables = CAGE:

- creatinine
- age
- gender
- ethnicity

### MGMT

CKD usually managed by GP or other physicians caring for pt e.g. diabetologists.

	Refer to nephrologist if:

	- stage 4 or 5 CKD
	- moderate proteinuria unless due to DM and already treated
	- proteinuria + haematuria
	- rapidly falling GFR (>5 in 1r or >10 in 5y)
	- HTN poorly controlled despite >4 antihypertensive drugs at therapeutic doses
		- known or suspected rare/genetic cause of CKD
	- suspected renal artery stenosis

4 main approaches to managing CKD:

1. **Investigation**: identifying and treating reversible causes
2. **Limiting progression/complications**
3. **Symptom control**
4. Preparation for **renal replacement therapy**

#### INVESTIGATION

Aim to identify and treat reversible causes of CKD.

- relieve obstruction

- stop nephrotoxic drugs

- deal with hypercalcaemia

- minimise cardiovascular risk - smoking, weight etc.

- tight glucose control in DM

#### LIMITING PROGRESSION/COMPLICATIONS

	BP
	renal bone disease
	cardiovascular modification
	diet


**BP:**

- small BP drop may save significant renal function
- target BP: <130/80
	- diabetic: <125/75 or ACR >70
- diabetic kidney disease: rx with ACEi or ARB, even if normotensive

**Renal bone disease:**

- risk of **osteodystrophy** or **adynamic bone disease**
- check PTH, treat if high
- phosphate rises in CKD 
	- will increase PTH further
	- precipitates in kidney + vasculature

**Cardiovascular modification:**

- CKD stage 1+2 has higher risk of cardiovascular death than of reaching ESRF
- statins in CKD with rasied lipids as per usual
- give aspirin, but beware risk of bleeding

**Diet:**

- r/v by dietitian
- health, moderate protein diet
- restrict K if hyperkalaemic
- avoid high phosphate foods e.g. milk, cheese, eggs

#### SYMPTOM CONTROL

	Anaemia
	Acidosis
	Oedema
	Restless legs/cramps

**Anaemia:**

- check haematinics
- replace **iron/B12/folate**
- consider **recombinant human erythropoietin** if above doesn't help
- if Hb still falls + no infection/haemolysis/blood loss, suspect red cell aplasia (anti-epo Abs)

**Acidosis:**

- consider **sodium bicarbonate supplements**
- improves symptoms
- may slow CKD progression
- caution with HTN

**Oedema:**

- **high doses loop diuretics**
- e.g. **furosemide** 250mg-2g/24h ± metolazone 5-10mg/24h PO each morning
- restrict fluid + sodium intake

**Restless legs/cramps:**

- check ferritin - low levels worsen symptoms
- **clonazepam** 0.5-2mg daily or **gabapentin** may help
- **quinine sulfate** 300mg nocte can help with cramps

#### PREPARATION FOR RRT

See notes.

#### PRESCRIBING IN CKD PTS

Relate dose modification to GFR, and extent to which drug is renally excreted.

If pt on dialysis depends on how well the drug is eliminated by dialysis.

Important for:

- aminoglycosides e.g. gentamicin
- cephalosporins
- some other abx
- heparin
- lithium
- opiates
- digoxin
