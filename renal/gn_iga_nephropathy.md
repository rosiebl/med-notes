# IgA NEPHROPATHY

IgA nephropathy is defined by the presence of IgA immune complex deposits in mesangial cells, in association with a mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis of varying severity.

Commonest glomerulonephritis in the developed world.

### PRESENTATION

Most present with macro- or microscopic **haematuria**; occasionally **nephritic** syndrome.

A typical patient is a young man with episodic macroscopic haematuria.

Recovery is often rapid between attacks.

May present a few days after an URTI (cf. post-streptococcal GN which appears weeks after URTI).

### INVESTIGATIONS

Renal biopsy:

- mesangial proliferation
- immunofluorescence shows deposits of IgA and C3

### MGMT

BP control with ACEi.

With nephritic presentation: immunosuppression may slow decline of renal function.

### PROGNOSIS

Prognosis is worse if:

- hypertension
- male
- proteinuria at presentation
- renal failure at presentation

20% of adults develop ESRF over ~20y.
