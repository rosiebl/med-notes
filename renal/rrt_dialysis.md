# RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY: DIALYSIS

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is therapy which replaces nonendocrine kidney function (blood filtration) and is used in patients with renal failure.


RRT options:

- dialysis
	- haemodialysis
	- haemofiltration
	- peritoneal dialysis
- transplant

Transplantation is the 'best' option but is major surgery + not always successful. Dialysis can maintain stability but has many complications.

**Conservative mgmt** is a reasonable option in pts for whom any for of RRT is unacceptable, e.g. very elderly, significant comorbidities. Focus care on symptom control and delaying progression of disease.

### STARTING DIALYSIS

RRT is considered once patient is in end-stage renal failure, or if they are suffering from serious complications of impaired renal function despite their GFR being outside of the criteria for "ESRF".

Mean GFR at start of dialysis usually ~8-10mL/min.

Indications for dialysis in AKI:

- refractory pulmonary oedema

- persistent hyperkalaemia (K >7mmol/L)

- severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2 or base excess <10)

- uraemic complications e.g. encephalopathy

- uraemic pericarditis

- drug overdose: barbituates, lithium, alcohol, salicylates, theophyline

### HAEMODIALYSIS

Blood is passed over a semi-permeable membrane against dialysis fluid passing in the opposite direction.

--> Blood is always meeting a less-concentrated solution.

--> Diffusion of small solutes occurs down the concentration gradient.

Larger solutes do not clear as effectively.

Ultrafiltration creates a negative transmembrane pressure and is used to clear excess fluid.


#### PROBLEMS

- disequilibration syndrome: neurological signs/symptoms due to cerebral oedema, which occur during or shortly after haemodialysis (also known as disequilbrium syndrome)

- hypotension

- time consuming

- **access problem**s

	- **AV fistula**
		- thrombosis
		- stenosis
		- steal syndrome: vascular insufficiency due to a fistula
	- **tunnelled venous access line**
		- infection
		- blockage
		- recirculation of blood


### HAEMOFILTRATION

Blood is filtered across a highly permeable membrane, with dialysate flowing in the same direction.

--> Allows movement of large and small soluts by convestion at almost the same rate.

Ultrafiltrate is replaced with an equal volume of fluid, so there is less haemodynamic instability.

Used in critically ill patients.

Impractical as long-term RRT because it takes much longer than haemodialysis to acheive the same clearance.

### PERITONEAL DIALYSIS

Peritoneum used as a semi-permeable membrane.

**Tenckhoff catheter** inserted into the peritoneal cavity and fluid infused, allowing solutes to diffuse slowly across.

Ultrafiltration acheived by adding osmotic agents e.g. lgucose to the fluid.

Simple to perform.

Can be carried out continuously at home - allows more freedom for patient.

Multiple possble regimens.

#### PROBLEMS

- PD peritonitis

- exit site infection

- loss of membrane function over time: can lead to technical failure and need for change of RRT


### COMPLICATIONS

Annual mortality ~20%: most due to cardiovascular disease.

Main complications of dialysis:

- cardiovascular disease
- protein-calorie malnutrition
- renal bone disease
- infection
- amyloid
- malignancy

**Cardiovascular disease:**

- MI + CVA much more common in dialysis pts
- probably due to combination of hypertension + calcium/phosphate dysregulation

**Protein-calorie malnutrion:** 

- common in hameodialysis
- associated with increased morbidity and mortality

**Renal bone disease:**

- high bone turnover
- renal osteodystrophy
	- alteration in bone morphology 
	- due to failure of kidneys to maintain normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus
- osteitis fibrosa
	- due to high PTH
	- bones become weak and deformed

**Infection:**

- uraemia causes granulocyte dysfunction
- sepsis-related mortality 100-300x greater in dialysis pts

**Amyloid:**

- amyloid accumulates in long-term dialysis pts
- may cause: 
	- carpal tunnel syndrome
	- arthralgia
	- fractures
	
**Malignancy:**

- commoner in dialysis pts
- ?related to cause of ESRF


### STOPPING DIALYSIS

8-20% of deaths in dialysis pts are due to its withdrawal.

Dialysis has major impact on quality of life: may be too much if pt v old or if there is comorbidity e.g. psychiatric or mobility issues.
