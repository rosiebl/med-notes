# MESANGIOCAPILLARY /MEMBRANOPROLIFERATIVE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS

Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis is also known as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

It is a glomerulonephritis caused by antibody deposits in the glomerular mesangium and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane.

### CLASSIFICATION

Mesangiocapillary GN used to be classifed as type I, II and III, but is not classified as **immune complex mediated** or **complement mediated**.

### IMMUNE-COMPLEX MEDIATED

IC mediated:

- circulating immune complexes deposit in the kidney and activate complement via the classical pathway.

Can usually find an underlying cause, e.g.: 

- hepatitis C
- SLE
- monoclonal gammopathies


### COMPLEMENT MEDIATED

Less common.

Complement mediated:

- persistent activation of the alternative complement pathway e.g. C3 nephritic factor

Pts may have extra-renal manifestations e.g. Drusen in retina.


### RENAL BIOPSY

Mesangial and endocapillary proliferation.

Thickened capillary basement membrane.

Double contouring (tramline) of capillary walls.

Immunofluorescence can show Ig staingin, complement staining or light chains depending on cause.

Electron microscopy shows electron dense deposits.

### RX

- treat cause

- **ACEi/ARB** for all

If the disease shows rapid progression, immunosuppress with **steroids Â± cyclophosphamide** if rapid deterioration in function.

New complement-targeted therapies e.g. eculizumab may be trialled.

### PROGNOSIS

Poor where no underlying cause found.

In pts who reach ESRF (usually idiopathic), disease can recur in transplants and lead to graft loss.
