# NEPHROTIC SYNDROME

Nephrotic syndrome is a triad of:

	1. proteinuria >3.5g/24h
	2. hypoalbuminaemia (<25g/L, usually much lower)
	3. oedema

	Usually with severe hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol >10mmol/L)
	
### CAUSES

Nephrotic syndrome is not a dx: always look for cause.

Can be due to primary renal disease or secondary to various systemic disorders.

**Primary causes:**

- minimal change disease

- membranous nephropathy

- focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

- mesangiocapillary GN

[See other notes]

**Secondary causes:**

- hepatitis B/C: usually membranous, hep C can cause MCGN

- SLE: class V lupus nephritis causes a membranous pattern

- diabetic nephropathy

- amyloidosis

- paraneoplastic: usually membranous pattern

- drug related

	- NSAIDs
	- penicillamine
	- anti-TNF
	- gold
	- usually membranous pattern

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Main cause of proteinuria is injury to the podocyte:

- podocytes wrap around glomerular capillaries

- maintain filtration barrier

- prevent large molecular weight proteins entering the urine

- effacement of foot processes or loss of podocytes --> heavy protein loss

Mechanism of nephrotic syndrome:

	gaps in podocytes
	~
	protein leak into urine (selectively: small > large)
	~
	--> PROTEINURIA >3.5g/24h
	~
	decrease in serum albumin due to leakage
	~
	--> HYPOALBUMINAEMIA <25g/L
	~
	decrease in intravascular oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminaemia 
	~
	fluid moves from intravascular compartment into tisues
	~
	--> OEDEMA
	~
	liver increases lipoprotein (albumin + cholesterol) synthesis in response to low oncotic pressure
	~
	--> HYPERLIPIDAEMIA >10mmol/L

### ASSESSMENT

#### HX

Pts present with pitting oedema:

- can be severe and rapid onset
- in dependent areas
- areas of low tissue resistance e.g. periorbitally

Ask about:

- acute or chronic infections
- drugs
- allergies
- systemic symptoms
	- autoimmunity
	- malignancy


#### SIGNS

- urine dip: protein ++++

- low albumin

- BP normal or mildly increased

- renal function usually normal or mildly impaired

#### DDX

Congestive cardiac failure:

- raised JVP
- pulmonary oedema
- mild proteinuria

Liver disease: hypoalbuminaemia.

#### INVESTIGATION

In children, avoid biopsy unless there is no response to steroids or if clinical features suggest a cause other than minimal change GN, e.g. age <1y, FHx, extrarenal disease (e.g. arthritis, rash, anaemia), renal failure, haematuria.

All adults need renal biopsy + full assessment (all tests for GN).

Bloods:

- FBC
- U&E
- LFT
- ESR
- CRP
- immunoglobulins
- electrophoresis
- complement - C3 and C4
- autoantibodies: ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM
- blood culture
- ASOT
- HBsAg
- anti-HCV

Urine:

- RBC casts
- MC&S
- Bence Jones protein
- ACR

Imaging:

- CXR
- renal ultrasound


### COMPLICATIONS

Main complications:

- susceptibility to infection
- thromboembolism
- hyperlipidaemia

**Susceptibility to infection:**

- 20% adult pts
- due to immunocompromise:
	- decreased serum IgG
	- decreased complement acticity
	- decreased T cell function
	- due to loss of immunoglobulin in urine + immunosuppressive Rx
- e.g. cellulitis, Strep infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
	
**Thromboembolism:**

- up to 40%
- DVT/PE
- renal vein thrombosis
- hypercoagulable state
- partly due to increased clotting factors + platelet abnormalities

**Hyperlipidaemia:** increased cholesterol and triglycerides, due to hepatic lipoprotein synthesis in response to low oncotic pressure.


### MGMT

4 main aspects to mgmt of nephrotic syndrome:

1. Reduce oedema

2. Reduce proteinuria

3. Reduce risk of complications

4. Treat underlying cause

#### REDUCE OEDEMA

- **loop diuretics** e.g. **furosemide** - often high dose

- IV route useful as gut oedema may prevent PO absorption

- daily weight: aim for 0.5-1kg los/day

- daily U&E

- fluid restrict: 1L/day

- salt restrict while giving diuretics

#### REDUCE PROTEINURIA

**ACEi** or **ARB** in all pts.

#### REDUCE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS

- **anticoagulate** if nephrotic range proteinuria

- **statin** to reduce cholesterol (although will often resolves when cause treated)

- treat infections promptly

- **vaccinate**

#### TREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE

- find and treat underlying infections, malignancy or systemic disease

- stop causative drugs
