# FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a chronic pathological process caused by injury to podocytes in the renal glomeruli in segments on the kidney (focal sclerosis), which progresses to **nephrotic syndrome** and ultimately ESRF. 

### CAUSES

Primary: idiopathic.

Secondary:

- vesicoureteric reflux

- IgA nephropathy

- Alport's syndrome

- vasculitis

- sickle cell disease

- heroin use

HIV is associated with the collapsing subtype (poor prognosis).

### PRESENTATION

Usually **nephrotic syndrome** or **proteinuria**.

~50% have impaired renal function.

### BIOPSY

Some glomeruli have csarring of certain segments, i.e. focal sclerosis.

Immunoflurescence: IgM and C3 deposits in affected areas.

### MGMT

Responds to **corticosteroids** in ~30%.

If steroid resistant, consider **cyclophosphamide** or **ciclosporin**.

### PROGNOSIS

Untreated most progress --> ESRF.

Spontaneous remission <10%.

Longer courses of Rx lead to response in up to 70%.

Pts presenting with abnormal renal function have much poorer prognosis: 30-50% --> ESRF.

Recurs in ~20% transplanted kidneys.

Mey respond to plasma exchange.
