# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

Acute kidney injury is a r**apid reduction in kidney function over hours to days**, as measured by serum urea and creatinine and leading to a failure to maintain fluid, electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis. It may be **reversible**.

KDIGO criteria for **dx of AKI**:

- rise in creatinine >26 micromol/L in 48h
- rise in creatinine >1.5 x baseline (best figure in last 3/12)
- urine output <0.5ml/kg/h for >6 consecutive hours

Up to 18% of hospital pts have AKI: consider risk in all.

### STAGING

KDIGO (Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes) staging system for AKI:

Stage | Serum creatinine (sCR) criteria | Urine output criteria
-- | -- | --
1 | increase >26 micromol/L in 48h OR increase >1.5 x baseline | <0.5ml/kg/h for >6 consecutive hours
2 | increase 2-2.9 x baseline | <0.5ml/kg/h for 12h
3 | increase >3 x baseline OR >354 micromol/L OR commenced on RRT at any stage | <0.3ml/kg/h for >24 consecutive hours OR anuria for 12h


### RISK FACTORS

Assess all pts admitted to hodpital for risk of AKI.

Risk factors:

- age >75

- chronic kidney disease

- cardiac failure

- peripheral vascular disease

- chronic liver disease

- diabetes

- drugs, esp new started

- sepsis

- poor fluid intake/increased losses

- hx of urinary symptoms


### CAUSES

Commonest causes: ischaemia, sepsis, nephrotoxins.

The causes of AKI may be:

- pre-renal (inadequate input)
- intrinsic renal (failure at some stage within the kidney)
- post-renal (something preventing adequate output)

#### PRE-RENAL

Due to **renal hypoperfusion** e.g.:

- hypotension, any cause
	- hypovolaemia
	- sepsis
- renal artery stenosis ± ACE-i

#### INTRINSIC RENAL

May need biopsy to dx.

May be:

- tubular
- glomerular
- interstitial
- vascular

**Tubular**: acute tubular necrosis is the commonest renal cause of AKI. Result of:

- pre-renal damage
- nephrotoxins
	- drugs e.g. aminoglycosides
	- radiological contrast
	- myoglobinuria in rhabdomyolysis	
- crystal damage e.g. ethylene glycol poisoning, uric acid
- myeloma
- hypercalcaemia

**Glomerular**:

- autoimmune e.g. SLE
- Henoch-Schonlein purpura
- drugs
- infections
- primary glomerulonephritides (see notes)

**Interstitial**:

- drugs
- infiltration with, e.g.:
	- lymphoma
	- infection
	- tumour lysis syndrome following chemotherapy

**Vascular**:

- vasculitis
- malignant HTN
- thrombus or cholesterol emboli from angiography
- haemolytic uraemic syndrome
- thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura
- large vessel occlusion e.g. dissection or thrombus

#### POST-RENAL

Caused by **urinary tract obstruction**:

- **luminal**
	- stones
	- clots
	- sloughed papillae
- **mural**
	- malignancy e.g. ureteric, bladder, prostate
	- benign prostatic hyperplasia
	- strictures
- **extrinsic compression**
	- malignancy, esp pelvic
	- retroperitoneal fibrosis

### ASSESSMENT

#### DR ABCDE

Use basic ABCDE approach, and as part of C **assess volume status**:

- BP
- JVP
- skin turgor
- capillary refill <2s
- urine output - catheterise
- lung creps
- peripheral oedema
- gallop rhythm on cardiac auscultation
- urgent K+ on a venous blood specimen
- ECG to check for life-threatening hyperkalaemia

#### HX

- risk factors

- comorbidities

- previous renal disease

- recent fluid intake/losses

- new drugs, incl chemotherapy

- systemic features
	- rash
	- joint pain
	- fevers
	
- other symptoms
	- productive cough
	- haemoptysis
	- GU symptoms
	- GI symptoms


#### EXAMINATION

Full systemic exam, perticularly looking for:

- palpable bladder

- palpable kidneys - polycystic disease

- abdominal/pelvic masses

- renal bruits - signs of renovascular disease

- rashes

### INVESTIGATIONS

#### URINE

**Always do urine dip**.

Dipstick can suggest:

- infection: leucocytes + nitrites
- glomerular disease: blood + protein

Urine microscopy;

- casts
- crystals
- cells

Culture for infection.

?Bence Jones protein.


#### BLOODS

- U&E
- FBC
- LFT
- clotting
- CK
- ESR
- CRP

?ABG for acid-base assessment.

Culture blood if signs of infection.

Blood film + renal immunology if systemic cause suspected:

- immunoglobulins + paraprotein electrophoresis
- complement: C3/C4
- autoantibodies: ANCA, ANA, anti-GBM, esp if haemoptysis
- ASOT


#### IMAGING

**Renal USS**:

- help distinguish obstruction vs. hydronephrosis
- cysts
- small kidneys
- masses
- assess corticomedullary differentiation - reduced in CKD

Complete anuria unusual in AKI, suggests obstructive cause. In elderly men, assume prostatic + catheterise. 

If catheterisation doesn't resolve anuria + suspect obstruction above prostate:

- **urgent USS** to check for hydronephrosis
- **?urgent CTKUB** (CT w/o contrast) - can show massess, calculi

?CXR if fluid overload.


### ACUTE VS CHRONIC

Suspect chronic kidney disease if:

- small kidney on USS: <9cm

- anaemia

- hypocalcaemia

- high phosphate

Only definite sign of CKD is previous blood results showing high creatinine/low GFR.


### REFERRAL

Always refer:

- hyperkalaemia in oligoanuric pt
- hyperkalaemia or fluid overload unresponsive to medical Rx
- urea >40 mmol/L ± signs of uraemia e.g. pericarditis
- suspected glomerulonephritis: blood + protein on urine
- systemic disease

Consider referral:

- no obvious reversible cause
- creatinine >300
- creatinine rising >50 micromol/L per day



### MGMT

Assess volume status (see above).

**Aim for euvolaemia**: 

- consider titrating input hourly
	- match previous hours output + 25mL/h for insensible losses
	- only practical in HDU setting
- if 24h fluid balance review:
	- match loss (urine, vomit, diarrhoea + drains) + 500mL insensible loss
- insensible loss higher if temp raised
- **avoid K-containing fluids** unless hypokalaemic

**Stop nephrotoxic drugs**: see below.

**Monitor** closely: fluid balance chart, daily weights, daily U&Es, fluid status exam.

**Nutrition** is vital: normal calorie intake or more if catabolism raised, e.g. burns, sepsis. Consider NG nutrition early.


#### TREAT CAUSE

**Pre-renal**:

- correct volume depletion
- treat sepsis with abx
- ?ICU referral for inotropic support if signs of shock

**Post-renal**:

- if obstruction likely cause:
	- catheterise
	- ?renal tract CTKUB
	- ?urology referral
- signs of obstruction/hydronephrosis on CT/USS:
	- discuss w/ urology re cystoscopy + retrograde stents/nephrostomy insertion

**Intrinsic renal**: refer early to nephrology if tubulointerstitial/glomerular pathology, signs of systemic disease, multi-organ involvement, indications for dialysis.

#### MANAGE COMPLICATIONS

Hyperkalaemia (see notes).

Pulmonary oedema (see notes).

Uraemia: 

- may require **dialysis** if severe or complications e.g. encephalopathy, pericarditis
- otherwise **symptomatic mgmt**

Acidaemia:

- may require dialysis
- consider **sodium bicarbonate** PO or IV if in HDU/ICU setting

#### INDICATIONS FOR DIALYSIS

- refractory pulmonary oedema

- persistent hyperkalaemia: >7mmol/L

- severe metabolic acidosis: pH <7.2 or base excess <10

- uraemic complications e.g. encephalopathy

- uraemic pericarditis (pericardial rub)

- drug overdose: BLAST
	- barbituates
	- lithium
	- alcohol (and ethylene glycol)
	- salicylates
	- theophyline 

#### DRUGS IN AKI

Should be stopped: may worsen renal function | Consider stopping: don't worsen renal function but increased risk of toxicity | Usually safe to continue 
-- | -- | -- 
ARBs | metformin | statins
diuretics | digoxin | B-blockers
NSAIDs | lithium | warfarin
aminoglycosides (gentamicin) |  | clopidogrel
ACE inhibitors |  | aspirin 75mg OD
amphotericin |  | paracetamol


### PROGNOSIS

Depends on early recognition + intervention.

More prolonged insult --> lower chance of full recovery of function.

Mortality by cause:

- burns 80%
- trauma/surgery 60%
- medical illness 30%
- obstetric/poisoning 10%
