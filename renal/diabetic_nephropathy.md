# DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY

DM is one of the commonest causes of end-stage renal failure in the UK: ~18%.

Kidney is a chief target for end-organ damage.

T1DM nephropathy:

- rare in 1st 5y
- rise in incidence after 10y
- peak in incidence at 15y, then falls
- those who haven't developed nephropathy at 35y are unlikely to do so

T2DM nephropathy:

- ~10% have nephropathy at dx
- up to 50% develop ti over the next 20y
- 20% T2DM develop end-stage renal failure

Screen annually for microalbuminuria.

### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Several mechanisms contribute to progression of diabetic nephropathy:

- early on: glomerular + tubular hypertrophy --> GFR transiently increases

Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGE) are produced by non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins from chronic hypoglycaemia

- AGE can trigger an inflammatory response

- leads to deposition of type IV collagen + mesangial expansion

- eventually leads to:
	- arterial hyalinization
	- thickening of the mesangium + glomerular basement membrane
	- nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions)
	

#### STAGES

Progression is usually in 4 stages:

**1. GFR elevated**: early in disease renal blood flow increases --> GFR increases + microalbuminuria. Falls back to normal as sugars controlled.

**2. Glomerular hyperfiltration**: over 5-10y mesangial expansion gradually occurs --> hyperfiltration at the glomerulus w/o microalbuminuria.

**3. Microalbuminuria**: indicates progression of disease as soon as it is seen. GFR may be raised or normal. Lasts another 5-10y.

**4. Nephropathy**: GFR begins to decline, proteinuria increases.

### MICROALBUMINURIA

**Microalbuminuria**: urine dipstick -ve for protein but urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) is >3mg/mmol (2.5 men; 3.5 women). 

Gives early warning of impending **renal** disease + is a strong independent risk factor for **cardiovascular** disease.

- if UACR >3, **ACE inhibitor** or **ARB** protects the kidneys
	- inhibits renin-angiotensin system 
	- reduces intra-glomerular pressure and hence proteinuria
	- give even if BP normal
	- ACEi usually 1st line; ARB if intolerant
	- SE:
		- U&Es incerase - monitor K and creatinine periodically
		- cough with ACEi
	
- target BP lower in DM pts with microalbuminuria/proteinuria

- **spironolactone** may help

- refer if UACR >7 Â± GFR falling by >5ml/min/1.73m^2/yr

Can be reversible with tight glycaemic + BP control + CV risk mgmt.
