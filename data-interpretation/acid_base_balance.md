# ACID-BASE BALANCE

Arterial blood pH closely regulated in health to 7.40 Â± 0.05.

Key principle: primary changes in **HCO3**- are **metabolic**, and in **CO2** are **respiratory**.

Simple method to assess:

1. Is there an acidosis or an alkalosis?

	- pH <7.35 = acidosis
	
	- pH >7.45 = alkalosis

2. Is CO2 abnormal? (normal = 4.7-6.0kPa)

	- CO2 is an acidic gas
	
	- is CO2 raised with acidosis or lowered with alkalosis?
		- if so, problem is respiratory
		- if there is no change or opposite change, problem is metabolic

3. Is HCO3 abnormal? (normal = 22-28mmol/L)

	- HCO3 is alkaline
	
	- is HCO3 raised with an alkalosis or lowered with an acidosis
		- if so, problem is respiratory
		- if there is no change or opposite change, problem is respiratory

### ANION GAP

The anion gap **estimates unmeasured plasma anions**: '**fixed' or organic acids** such as phosphate, ketones + lactate, which are hard to measure directly.

Calculated as **difference between plasma cations (Na+ and K+) and anions (Cl- and HCO3-)**.

Normal range: 10-18mmol/L.

Helpful in determining cause of metabolic acidosis.

- if there is a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, it implies the acidosis is due to an increase in one of the unmeasured plasma anions, e.g. lactate, ketones etc.

### METABOLIC ACIDOSIS

Low pH, low HCO3-.

#### METABOLIC ACIDOSIS + INCREASED ANION GAP

Due to increased production, or reduced excretion, of fixed/organic acids.

HCO3- falls and unmeasured anions associated with the acids accumulate.

Lactic acid:

- shock

- infection

- tissue ischaemia

Urate: renal failure.

Ketones:

- diabetes mellitus

- alcohol

Drugs/toxins:

- salicylates

- biguanides

- ethylene glycol

- methanol

#### METABOLIC ACIDOSIS + DECREASED ANION GAP

Due to loss of bicarbonate or ingestion of H+ ions (Cl- is retained).

- renal tubular acidosis

- diarrhoea

- drugs: acetozolamide

- Addison's disease

- pancreatic fistula

- ammonium chloride ingestion

### METABOLIC ALKALOSIS

High pH, high HCO3-.

- vomiting

- potassium depletion

- burns

- ingestion of base

### RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS

Low pH, high CO2.

Caused by Type 2 respiratory failure of any lung, neuromuscular or physical cause.

Most commonly COPD.

Look at PaO2: likely to be low.

### RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS

High pH, low CO2.

Result of hyperventilation of any cause.

CNS causes:

- stroke

- subarachnoid bleed

- meningitis

Others:

- mild/moderate asthma

- anxiety

- altitude

- high temperature

- pregnancy

- pulmonary emboli (reflex hyperventilation)

- drugs e.g. salicylates

### SUMMARY

N.B. Should perhaps say acidaemia + alkalaemia rather than acidosis + alkalosis.

Type | Primary change | With compensation
-- | -- | --
 | | 
Respiratory acidosis | high PaCO2 | high PaCO2 + high HCO3
Metabolic acidosis | low HCO3 | low HCO3 + low PaCO2
 | | 
Respiratory alkalosis | low PaCO2 | low PaCO2 + low HCO3
Metabolic alkalosis | high HCO3 | high HCO3 + high PaCO2
