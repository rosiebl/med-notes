# UTI & PYELONEPHRITIS

Bacteriuria: bacteria in the urine. May be asymptomatic or symptomatic.

UTI: urinary tract infection, defined by the presence of a pure growth of >10^5 organisms per mL of fresh mid-stream urine.

Lower UTI: 

- urethra - urethritis
- bladder - cystitis
- prostate - prostatitis

Upper UTI: renal pelvis - pyelonephritis.

### CLASSIFICATION

Uncomplicated: normal renal tract and function.

Complicated: 

- abnormal renal/GU tract
- voiding difficulty/obstruction
- decreased renal function
- impaired host defences
- virulent organism e.g. Staph aureus

### RISK FACTORS

- female
- sex
- exposure to spermicide in women - diaphragm or condoms
- pregnancy
- menopause
- decreased host defence
	- immunosuppression
	- diabetes mellitus
- urinary tract
	- obstruction
	- stones
	- catheter
	- malformation

UTI is common in pregnancy. Often asymptomatic until serious pyelonephritis or premature delivery Â± fetal delivery occurs --> do routine dipstick in pregnancy.

Urine in catheterised bladders almost always infected - rx pointless unless pt ill.

### ORGANISMS

**E coli** - 75-95% in community, >41% in hospital.

Occasionally:

- other enterbacteriaceae e.g. Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumonia
- other bacteria e.g. Staph saprophyticus


### SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

##### SYMPTOMS

Acute pyelonephritis:

- high fever
- rigors
- vomiting
- loin pain and tenderness
- oliguria (if AKI)

Cystitis:

- frequency
- dysuria
- urgency
- haematuria
- suprapubic pain

Prostatitis:

- flu-like symptoms
- low backache
- few urinary symptoms
- swollen or tender prostate on PR

##### SIGNS

- fever
- abdo or loin pain or tenderness
- foul-smelling urine

Occasionally: distended bladder, enlarged prostate.

### INVESTIGATIONS

Urine dipstick.

If **dipstick +ve** for nitrites or leucocytes: treat empirically while waiting for sensitivities on a mid-stream urine sample.

If **dipstick -ve but pt symptomatic**, send MSU for lab MC&S to confirm.

### PREVENTION

Drink more water.

Abx prophylaxis, continuously or post-coital - decreases rtes in women with many UTIs.

Self-rx with single abx dose when symptoms start.

Cranberry juice/tablets - 10-20% decrease risk of symptomatic recurrent infxn.

### MANAGEMENT

Drink lots, urinate often.

#### Bacterial UTI in adult non-pregnant women

Empirical rx for presumed E coli in otherwise healthy women with lower UTI:

- **trimethoprim** 200gm/12h PO

- **nitrofurantoin** 50mg/6h PO 3-6d

- **amoxicillin** 500mg/8h PO

Upper UTI:

- urine culture

- e.g. **co-amxoiclav** 1.2g/8h IV, then PO when afebrile

- avoid nitrofurantoin

Trimethoprim resistance is common.


#### Bacterial UTI in pregnant women

Get expert help.

Any bacteriuria, symptomatic or not, should be treated with abx.

Dipstick and urine culture repeated at every antenatal visit.

#### Bacterial UTI in adult men

Take seriously - often results from functional or anatomical abnormality.

Upper UTI, recurrent UTI or failure to respond to abx --> urologist.

Consider prostatitis, epididymitis, chlamydial infxn.

May need 2wk course of **quinolone** e.g. **levofloxacin**.

Abx for asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly men not recommended, doesn't reduce mortality or morbidity.
