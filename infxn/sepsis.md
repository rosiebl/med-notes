# SIRS & SEPSIS

NB. Septicaemia was previously used to denote the presence f multiplying bacteria in the circulation, but the term has been replaced with the definitions below.

### SIRS

SIRS = systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

SIRS is thought to be a central component of the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock.

Inolves cytokine cascades, free-radical production and release of vasoactive mediators.

SIRS is defined as hthe presence of 2 or more of the following factors:

- temperature >38 or <36 C

- tachycardia >90 bpm

- respiratory rate >20 breaths/min OR PaCO2 <4.3kPa

- WBC >12 x 10^9/L OR <4 x10^9/L OR >10% immature (band) forms

### SEPSIS SYNDROMES

Sepsis and sepsis-related syndromes are related to SIRS.

#### SEPSIS

Sepsis is defined as **SIRS** occuring in the presence of **infection**.

#### SEVERE SEPSIS

Severe sepsis is defined as **sepsis** with evidence of **organ hypoperfusion**. 

e.g. hypoxaemia, oliguria, lactic acidosis, altered cerebral function.

#### SEPTIC SHOCK

**Severe sepsis** with **hypotension** (systolic BP <90 or MAP <60) despite adequate fluid resuscitation, or the requirement for vasopressors/inotropes to maintain blood pressure.

### MANAGEMENT: SEPSIS 6

1. high-flow oxygen
2. blood cultures
3. IV antibiotics
4. IV fluid resuscitation
5. check lactate
6. monitor hourly urine output

Try to take cultures before abx but don't delay treatment. Take 2x peripheral blood, plus e.g. urine, sputum, CSF.

Give abx within 1 hour.

Choice of abx depends on trust and suspected source. Give empirical rx if no clear source.

After fluid bolus of 20mL/kg crystalloid (or 7mL/kg colloid) repeat BP and ABG.

If SBP remains <90 after fluid bolus, consider ICU referral for goal-directed rx. (Aiming for CVP 8-12, MAP >65mmHg, UO >0.5mL/kg/h)

Low dose steroid may improve BP but do not improve mortality.
