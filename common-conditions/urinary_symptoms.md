# URINARY SYMPTOMS

### DYSURIA

Can mean painful urination (uralgia) or difficult micturition (voiding difficulty).

#### URALGIA

Typically from urethral, bladder or vaginal inflammation.

Causes: 

- UTI
- perfumed bath products
- spermicides
- urethral syndrome


Also think of:

- urethral caruncle in post-menopausal women (fleshy outgrowth of distal urethral mucosa, typically from posterior urethral lip)
- prostatitis
- STI/urethritis 
- vaginitis 
- vulvitis 

Rare causes: 

- stones
- urethral lesions e.g. carcinoma, lymphoma, papilloma
- post-partum complications e.g. retained products of conception

#### STRANGURY

Strangury is urethral pain, usually referred from the bladder base, causing constant distressing desire to urinate even if there is little urine to void.

Causes:

- stones
- catheters
- cystitis
- prostatitis
- bladder neoplasia
- rarely:
	- endometriosis
	- schistosomiasis


### VOIDING DIFFICULTY

Symptoms:

- poor flow
- straining to void
- intermittnet stream
- incontinence, e.g. overflow
- retention, acute or chronic
- incomplete emptying Â± UTI from residual urine

N.B. Remember faecal impaction as a cause of retention with overflow.

#### Causes

Obstructive:

- prostatic hyperplasia
- urehtral stricture: commonly post-traumatic, post-gonoccocal
- early oedema after bladder neck repair
- uterine prolapse
- retroverted gravid uterus
- fibroids
- ovarian cysts
- urethral foreign body
- ectopic uterocele
- bladder polyp
- cancer

Bladder overdistension, e.g. after epidural for childbirth.

Detrusor wekaness or myopathy:

- causes incomplete empyting + dribbling overflow incontinence
- do cytometry/electromyography
- causes include: 
	- neurological disease
	- interstitial cystitis
- may lead to contracted bladder needing substitution enterocystoplasty

Drugs:

- epidural anaesthesia
- tricyclics
- anticholinergics

CNS:

- suprapontine (stroke)
- cord lesions: cord injury, MS
- peripheral nerve: prolapsed disc, diabetic or other neuropathy
- reflex due to pain e.g. herpes infection


### FREQUENCY

Aim to differentiate high urine production from frequent passage of small amounts of urine, or bladder compression or outflow obstruction.

High urine production:

- diabetes mellitus and insipidus
- polydipsia
- alcohol
- renal tubular disease
- adrenal insufficiency

Frequent passage of small amounts of urine:

- cystitis
- urethritis
- neurogenic bladder

Bladder compression/outflow obstruction:

- pregnancy
- bladder tumour
- enlarged prostate

### OLIGURIA/ANURIA

Oliguria: urine output of <400mL/24h OR <0.5mL/kg/hr. Can be a sign of shock or acute kidney injury.

Anuria: urine output <50mL/24h. 

In catheterised pt with sudden anuria consider catheter blockage.

In slow decline of oliguria to anuria, renal dysfunction more likely.

### POLYURIA

Increased urine volume e.g. >3L/24h.

Causes:

- over-enthusiastic IV fluid rx
- diabetes mellitus + insipidus 
- high calcium
- pyschogenic polydipsia/PIP syndrome
- polyuric phase of recovering tubular necrosis

### IRRITATIVE OR OBSTRUCTIVE BLADDER SYMPTOMS

Irritative symptoms:

- urgency
- dysuria
- frequency
- nocturia

Frequency and nocturia associated with causes of polyuria.

Obstructive symptoms:

- reduced size and force of urinary stream
- hesistancy
- interruption of stream during voiding
- terminal dribbling

Causes of obstructive symptoms:

- usually prostatic hyperplasia
- urethral stricture
- tumour
- urethral valves
- bladder neck contracture

Maximum flow rate of urine usually 18-30mL/s.

### TERMINAL DRIBBLING

Dribbling at end of urinationg, often seen in conjunction with incontinence following incomplete urination, associated with prostatism.

### URINARY CHANGES

Cloudy urine:

- suggests pus (UTI)
- often normal phosphate deposition in alkaline urine

Pneumaturia:

- bubbles in urine as it is passed
- occurs with UTI
- due to gas-forming organisms
- OR may signal entrovesical fistula
	- diverticulitis
	- Crohn's disease
	- neoplastic bowel disease

Nocturia:

- occurs with irritative bladder
- diabetes mellitus
- UTI
- reversed diurnal rhythm, seen in renal and cardiac failure

Haematuria:

- RBC in urine
- due to neoplasia or glomerulonephritis until proven otherwise
