# CONSTIPATION

Constipation reflects increased transit time or palvic dysfunction.

F:M ~ 2:1

Aim to find indications of important pathology, e.g.:

- constipation + rectal bleeding ~ cancer
- constipation + distension + active bowel sounds ~ stricture/GI obstruction
- constipation + menorrhagia ~ hypothyroidism

### DEFINITIONS OF CONSTIPATION

Definitions of constipation differ:

- <2 bowel actions/week
- less often than person's normal habit
- passed with difficulty, straining or pain
- sense of incomplete evacuation

Can use Rome criteria.

#### ROME CRITERIA

Constipation = presence of >2 symptoms during bowel movements (BMs):

- straining for >25% of BMs
- lumpy or hard stools for >25% of BMs
- sensation of incomplete evacuations for >25% of BMs
- sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage for >25% of BMs
- manual manoeuvres to facilitate at least 25% of BMs
- fewer than 3 BMs per week

Chronicity entails constiaption for the last 90 days, with onset >6/12 ago.


### CAUSES

#### GENERAL

- poor diet ± lack of exercise

- poor fluid intake/dehydration

- IBS

- old age

- post-op pain

- hospital - environment (less privacy, having to use bed pan)

- distant, squalid or fearsome toilets

#### ANORECTAL DISEASE

(esp if painful)

- anal or colorectal cancer

- fissures, strictures, herpes

- rectal prolapse

- proctalgia fugax

- mucosal ulceration/neoplasia

- pelvic muscle dysfunction/levator ani syndrome

#### INTESTINAL ONSTRUCTION

- colorectal carcinoma

- strictures (e.g. Crohn's)

- pelvic mass (e.g. fetus, fibroids)

- diverticulosis (rectal bleeding is commoner presentation)

- psuedo-obstruction

#### METABOLIC/ENDOCRINE

- hypercalcaemia

- hypothyroidism (rarely presents with constipation)

- hypokalaemia

- porphyria

- lead poisoning

#### DRUGS

- opiates e.g. morphine, codeine

- anticholinergics e.g. tricyclics

- iron

- some antacids e.g. with aluminium

- diuretics e.g. furosemide

- calcium channel blockers

#### NEUROMUSCULAR

Slow transit form decreased propulsive activity.

- spinal or pelvic nerve injury e.f. trauma, surgery

- aganglionosis e.g. Chagas, Hirschprung's disease

- systemic sclerosis

- diabetic neuropathy

#### OTHER

- chronic laxative abuse - rare, diarrhoea is commoner

- idiopathic slow transit

- idiopathic megarectum/colon

- psychological e.g. anorexia nervosa, depression, abuse as a child

### INVESTIGATIONS

Indications for investigation: 

- age >40
- change in bowel habit
- associated symptoms e.g. weight loss, PR mucous or blood, tenesmus

Blood: FBC, ESR, U&E, Ca2+, TFT.

Sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of abnormal mucosa.

Barium enema/colonoscopy if suspected colorectal malignancy.

Transit studies; anorectal physiology; biopsy for Hirschprung's may be needed.


### TREATMENT

Reassurance, drinking more, diet/exercise advice.

Treat causes.

High fibre diet often advised - may cause bloating with no change to constipation.

Only use drugs if these all fail, use for short times only.

**Stimulant** e.g. **senna ± bulking agent** often more effective + cheaper than other agents.

#### DRUGS

**Bulking agents:**

- increase faecal mass to timulate peristalsis
- take with plenty of fluid
- take a few days to work
- bran powder
- ispaghula husk

**Stimulant laxatives:**

- increase intestinal motility
- don't use in intestinal obstruction or acute colitis
- avoid long term use - may cause colonic atony and hypokalaemia
- SE: abdominal cramps
- senna
- bisacodyl tablets or suppositories
- glycerol suppositories


Stool softeners:

- particularly useful in manageing painful anal conditions e.g. fissure
- arachis oil enemas
- liquid paraffin - do not use for a long time due to SE

Osmotic laxatives:

- retain fluid in the bowel
- lactulose
	- produces osmotic diarrhoea of low faecal pH
	- discourages growth of ammonia-producing organisms
- macrogol (e.g. movicol)
	- useful in hepatic encephalopathy
	- SE bloating so limited role in constipation
- magnesium salts
	- useful for rapid bowel evacuation
- phosphate salts
	- useful for rapid bowel evacuation before procedure
	
Don't use sodium salts - can cause sodium and water retention.
