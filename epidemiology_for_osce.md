# EPIDEMIOLOGY FOR OSCE


Sensitivity and specificity: start with the patient and then go to the test, i.e. of all the people with the disease, how many will actually test positive.

- sensitivity: the proportion of people who actually have a disease who are found to have it via a test (correctly identified as positive - TRUE POSITIVES). e.g. of all the people with a PE, 95% will have a positive D-dimer

- specificity: the proportion of people who do not have a disease who will be found not to have it via a test (correctly identified as negative - TRUE NEGATIVES). e.g. of all patients who don't have a PE, 16% will have a negative D-dimer.

PPV + NPV: start with the test and then go to the patient, i.e. of all the people who tested positive, how many will actually have the disease.

- positive predictive value: the proportion of people testing positive for a disease who actually have the disease. e.g. the PPV of D-dimer is 21%, which means 21% of people who test positive for D-dimer have a PE.

- negative predictive value: the proportion of people testing negative for disease who actually do not have the disease. e.g. the NPV of D-dimer is 93.3% which means 93.3% of patients who have a negative D-dimer will not have a PE.

- relative risk: measures the increased or decreased probability you will have a disease if you have been exposed to a certain factor.
	- RR = 1 means risk is the same in the exposed and unexposed groups.
	- RR > 1 means there is increased risk in the exposed group
	- RR < 1 means there is decreased risk in the exposed group

- absolute risk reduction: the absolute change in risk - the risk of an event in the control group minus the risk of an event in the treated group. Usually expressed as a percentage.

- relative risk reduction: proportion of the risk removed by treatment - the absolute risk reduction divded by the initial risk in the control group. Usually expressed as a percentage.

e.g. risk of death in control group is 1.5. risk of death in treated group is 1. the absolute risk reduction is 50%. the relative risk reduction is 33%.


- p-value: the likelihood that your result is due to chance. Values are usually 0.05 or 5%. If the p value is <5% then there is less than a 5% chance that your results are due to chance, and therefore the result is considered to be statistically significant. If the p-value is equal or >5% it is not statistically significant, and there is not enough evidence to disprove the null hypothesis.  

- 95% confidence interval: you are 95% confident that the true value lies within a range. 

- number needed to treat/harm: the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one event. This is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction, i.e. 1/ARR

- odds ratio: odds of an event in the treated group divided by the odds of an event in the control group. Usually expressed as a decimal proportion. 


- trials
